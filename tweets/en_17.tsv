A lot of hot air in the USA just now calling @TulsiGabbard a ‚ÄúRussian asset‚Äù, a smear first put out by Artillery Clinton, for challenging the official US strategy or lack of it.  There is a Russian asset in a position of influence in the west.   That is Boris Johnson. https://t.co/Xc5KhFSvZK

@AltuKop @WHL_Rozzer We all thought someone like Mourinho would change Levy‚Äôs thinking but he turned out to be another Levy puppet. Conte is no one‚Äôs fall, he has made his position clear and I believe Levy hired him and Paratici for a reason. Big, big summer ahead for us.

@andersostlund Unfortunately Pres Biden &amp; UK PM Johnson already didnt follow through on agreement with Ukraine that if Russia ever invaded both countries would militarily defend Ukraine. To me that is why Putin gathered forces slowly to see if UK &amp; US or NATO forces would move into position

By taking a reticent position in defending #Ukraine , the US is strengthening the legitimacy of a militarized EU. We should consider the unintended consequences.
@ClemzyPaul Nigeria has put us in the position where we can only try to choose the least corruptible. The fact is there is no saint amongst them. We can only try to put someone who has a good track record and we believe can actually do the job.
@CurtisHouck Having cheaper gas &amp; heating prices. So a great position in the history books.  The left needs to all leave the USA you are just weighing us down and it's not even funny anymore.
@DangerSIP @Mattius2k @SkySportsPL You're very wide of the mark here. Pickford has been pretty much the only consistently strong performer for us. He can't be faulted for our current position, at all.

@guardian Why ? Ukraine is the only country that can enable NATO to position themselves just 400km from Russias capital city. The imenence of this act was the reason Russia felt they had no choice but to enter Ukraine to protect their soveriegn borders from the enemy,NATO and the US.

@laurnorman @Amb_Ulyanov Nothing is positive about the JCPOA at the moment. Russia/Iran/China are in a win-win position and the US/UK/Germany/EU are in a lose-lose. No deal is bad, signed deal is worse for everyone not running an authoritarian dictatorship or authoritarian theocracy.

@ReginaWilhelmi1 @tedcruz Now Biden will say $4 a gallon is cheap and he saved us all after telling us he can't get prices down but President Trump had gas prices around $1.79 a gallon for 4 straight years.  Biden is a mess and shouldn't even be in a position of power.  It's getting so bad.
