Again with the de-Nazi stuff tho ‚ÄúThe key issue for us is the status of Crimea and Donbass.  And a number of humanitarian issues: denazification, the rights of the Russian-speaking population and the Russian language‚Äù
Am I being thick but Putin is claiming they are ridding Ukraine of nazis. However his support from the West is only coming from nazis or borderline nazis e.g. Farage, Fox (Lawrence and News) ü§î #denazification #fascism #ClosetheSkyoverUkraine #UkraineUnderAttack

@DeactWatkins Just use Google. You will see for yourself how the western media covered Ukraine since 2014.  Now they found a new enemy for the world to hate.  Going by their own reports, Putin wasn't lying about denazification. https://t.co/0wOIn6cUZW
#denazification interesting drop. https://t.co/is2Upl5TDE

@Digit_paris @ShortcakeMangum @InfraHaz Because those are anti-communist fabrications with no basis in reality. During the USSR, the population of all Soviet republics grew rapidly. Only during the Second World War and 90s did we see a decline in population. Denazification in Ukraine is a tragedy, but NATO is to blame.
@EndGameWW3 Denazification nonsense didn't stick, as expected.
From denazification to ecological vandalism. This isn't even a war of conquest now, it's a war of destruction, murder and theft. https://t.co/e8zW5sMjey
Further context for what Putin‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúdenazification‚Äù really means - a war of hatred and slaughter targeted at a nation the Kremlin has long sought to dehumanise. #SlavaUkraini #StandWithUkraine https://t.co/ICK9TbWyKq
@glukhovsky Denazification or decommunization?! For how long we‚Äôll be pretendending that communism went gone with Stalin‚Äôs death?! Putin‚Äôs father-figure anyway.
@gregcloney @happynataliya @The_Real_Fly Russia is an independent nation. Can invade anyone they want too.  NATO calls it's wars - democratization. Russia calls it denazification.   Free country - can do whatever they want.
@GustavoKTool @lexfridman 2/ not as popular as ANY msm will have you believe, no matter if it's BBC running a sensationalist story in 2014 or RT running war justification propaganda today.  You can also compare far-right across multiple countries and then wonder, why don't they need "denazification"?
@HollowHanz @Innk09526182 Putin is going to march all the way to Washington with his 50 year old tanks and chase away all those Nazis of the Azov. Brigade! Denazification !!!
@Hoodwink666 @HelenAngel @Jeremiah23044 @EndGameWW3 U compare blitzkrig ost operation through 3 directions and one ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù in Ukraine ? Bro how many chromosomes u have? Daddy Vlady told that a goal is denazification which means Kiev where Rada is. Every other city is unnecessary at all
@ianbremmer time for you to retire. you have lost any reasonable connection with reality. NATO was just one of the fake motives to start aggression. What about de-militarization, denazification, bacteriological laboratories, nuclear weapons development, water for Crimea? stop spreading lies
@IAPonomarenko Their goblin Nebeznya is still talking about ‚Äúdenazification.‚Äù It seems that his time in New York is preventing him from seeing the news of all those dead generals.
@intorpere @MaajidNawaz ‚ÄúDenazification‚Äù its propaganda 101 their copying the nazis tactics, to gain suport or lead a people create a moral enemy , the Nazis  did it to the jews the americans did it to the africans  In ww1 britain sod it to germany and the romans did it yo all none romans
Is #Mariupol the hardest hit city in Ukraine? Are they targeting that as the home of Azov and key to denazification? Will other cities be spared the same fate, and once Mariupol falls the Russians can claim some sort of denazification victory.
@Joanna_Szostek Filtering as in checking for the tattoos containing nazi symbolism. Why did you not mention this details as it clarifies the ‚Äúfiltering‚Äù bit? Denazification is not equivalent to getting rid of Ukrainians. Unless only neo Nazis can be considered true  Ukrainians.
@JordanUhl Now ask "If your respected leader called upon you to go into another country on a 'denazification' [i.e., eliminate Nazis/neo-Nazis] mission, to liberate your countrymen at risk of slaughter &amp; genocide, would you heed the call?"
@KGrumpallo @BBlues60 There are those minority groups on the rise in poland, germany and US aswell does that mean Russia should start its denazification there aswell?
Lavrov: denazification now means allowing us to pour toilet water into Ukrainians‚Äô heads https://t.co/ov7F1DLsKc
@LehmannFrederik @j_mcnulty54b @ICM64 @JoePostingg George Lincoln Rockwell fought in the American military, did that make postwar America a fascist free nation? No country on the face of the planet has *ever* been denazified.  Denazification is a myth and a nice bedtime story, but it's wildly untrue.
@leonidragozin Uh yeah and Israel opposes your invasion. Kinda hard to talk ‚Äúdenazification‚Äù when Israel is against you.
@luegen_presse_ @JT_1977 @GGatilov @mbachelet Azov idiots are around 4k w/ many foreigners. These groups exists in every country and generally a minority, here in a complex context of war. In a way, Putin created them. Russians nazis are 100k to date, "pure blood" idiots. How is YOUR denazification ? https://t.co/I4QC6ais4J
@MKoitmae @visegrad24 So you are aiming for the Denazification of Poland.
@MRune @wil_da_beast630 But it was hardly a coincidence that the original argument was the ‚ÄúdeNazification‚Äù of Ukraine. Azov Battalion was highlighted in an attempt to confuse the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù. Mass civilian casualties and demolishing cities removed any question. Then Russia got canceled!
@mtracey They‚Äôre looking for an out. All they need is some way to sell a ‚Äúwin‚Äù to the Russian people and minimize the fallout to their economy and reputation going forward. They don‚Äôt give a shit about ‚Äúdenazification‚Äù. They want a buffer between NATO and Russia soil.
@MyManBerzerk @rainydio @weel @ResistanceTeach @Global_Mil_Info Denazification is a myth, subterfuge by Putin to invade. Zelenskyy is Jewish and the offspring of family killed by Nazis during WW2. Denazification had nothing to do with why Putin invaded Ukraine
@NarchoArmChair @but_rly_tho @NotaCommie7 @insurgentspod @JordanUhl @robrousseau Denazification in east germany? When did that happen?
@narcIsGoldmund @IAPonomarenko pfff. No. Huge reparations. Seizing ALL terrorussian nuclear weapon. Prohibition to have armed forcves for 50 years. Complete denazification of russian state and russian people.
@nexta_tv This was a nazi act. Russia needs denazification of country.
@nypost Ever since they started using captured soldiers for propaganda, I've Stopped caring for Ukrainian military &amp; politicians  May b Putin was right... Ukraine needs denazification  Ukrainian military officers should be ashamed of themselves for this
@olex_scherba @MelnykAndrij Denazification Demilitarization These are the reasons why Putin has sent his army to kill Ukrainians including children 70+. This aggression is a barbaric crime not seen since WWII.I swear we will ensure that each war criminal faces justice. Dmytro Kuleba https://t.co/ux0AA1tJ5n
@OwenJones84 @joinaunionpls It's not - "dirtbag left" would be more accurate but it's distasteful. I mean ppl who retweet the Russian embassy calling for the denazification of Ukraine, or hail Russian troops as "peacemakers", citing evidence from Russian Nazis
President #Zalensky is a Jew, but Russia claims #Ukraine is full of Nazis, yet, #Zalensky doesn‚Äôt want ‚Äúdenazification‚Äù ü§îüá∫üá¶
@QRSTUVWHi @farahmja @XHNews Indeed. I wonder if AZOV would have become 900 strong had Putin not invaded in 2014.  And well done for not mentioning the 3,000 neo Nazi members of Wagner that the Kremlin employs.  Putin feels so strongly about"denazification" that he literally employs actual nazis... ü§¶
@RealScottRitter ASB Military News BREAKING: Russia &amp; DPR forces announce ‚Äòcomplete denazification‚Äô of the 53rd brigade of Ukrainian troops in the Mariupol direction ‚Äî the 53rd has suffered heavy losses.

@SamRamani2 is peacekeeping the same sort of euphemism as "denazification"? just another excuse to pour more money and people down the shitter?
@seginusnews2015 @maytham956 No, demilitarization and denazification is NOT negotiable!

@snusmumric @pixelmator @TwisterMc They will hate you if you fail to stand up to Putin in the foreseeable future. Start with the denazification of Russia.

@StateDept @USEmbassySerbia @SecBlinken @CNN The war will end when complete demilitarization and denazification are carried out, Ukraine recognizes the new states and Crimea within the Russian Federation. And of course, with the military neutral status of Ukraine. It's so simple.
That's planned destruction of Ukraine same with carpet bombing of civilians not imaginary "denazification". https://t.co/APw2dwfsgl
