@nypost Ever since they started using captured soldiers for propaganda, I've Stopped caring for Ukrainian military &amp; politicians  May b Putin was right... Ukraine needs denazification  Ukrainian military officers should be ashamed of themselves for this
@ukraine_world @olgatokariuk The goals of the Ukrainian operation were announced by Mr. Putin - Demilitarization, denazification, non-aligned status, recognition of the Crimea, the DPR and the LPR
@NarchoArmChair @but_rly_tho @NotaCommie7 @insurgentspod @JordanUhl @robrousseau Denazification in east germany? When did that happen?

@LehmannFrederik @j_mcnulty54b @ICM64 @JoePostingg George Lincoln Rockwell fought in the American military, did that make postwar America a fascist free nation? No country on the face of the planet has *ever* been denazified.  Denazification is a myth and a nice bedtime story, but it's wildly untrue.

This is the man Ramzan Kadyrov that Simeon wants to interview, he is a human rights abuser.  It was never about denazification  https://t.co/yTEqNAY9Q7
@leonidragozin Uh yeah and Israel opposes your invasion. Kinda hard to talk “denazification” when Israel is against you.
@Rogozin @Rogozin  you do know what happens next if this is not about protecting Ukraine and denazification and just a land grab instead right? Essentially you all just committed suicide oh, just like the Nazis, we have a saying in America, come correct or get rekt https://t.co/8StBjNp9ow

@RyanReed0522 @crypto522 What is that? Russian propaganda at it‘s finest. I said Germans were collectively responsible for enabling Hitler, this is why the actual denazification of Germany was a thing. Do I hate all Germans now? My great grandfather, an ethnic German was fighting nazis during WWII. Idiot

@Digit_paris @ShortcakeMangum @InfraHaz Because those are anti-communist fabrications with no basis in reality. During the USSR, the population of all Soviet republics grew rapidly. Only during the Second World War and 90s did we see a decline in population. Denazification in Ukraine is a tragedy, but NATO is to blame.

@MRune @wil_da_beast630 But it was hardly a coincidence that the original argument was the “deNazification” of Ukraine. Azov Battalion was highlighted in an attempt to confuse the “woke”. Mass civilian casualties and demolishing cities removed any question. Then Russia got canceled!
"Denazification" of Ukrainian forests I guess.. #StopRussia https://t.co/dbvt5Z2jFd
@DeactWatkins Just use Google. You will see for yourself how the western media covered Ukraine since 2014.  Now they found a new enemy for the world to hate.  Going by their own reports, Putin wasn't lying about denazification. https://t.co/0wOIn6cUZW

@Uinp_gov_ua You know, I support Ukraine (as I support any sovereign nation being illegally invaded) and I still do, but I must say after almost three weeks of listening to comments made by journalists/centrist pundits/institutions, I have to agree that a bit of denazification won’t go amiss.
