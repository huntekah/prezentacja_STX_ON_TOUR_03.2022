@Breaking911 These sanctions on Russia are working really well; imagine what they must be paying for gas. Let's say 50 rub/litter, 50 rub = $.45, 1gal =3.8L.  So 1 gal of gas in Russia is les than $2.

@CNN @Sen_JoeManchin @wolfblitzer NATO expansion triggered this war.  US + West imposed sanctions and Russia is reciprocating.

@CurtisHouck In our history books, US is perpetrator.  We remember 7th fleet, 1971 We remember sanctions against us in 1998 after nuke testing.
@DavidMDrucker @dcexaminer He was wrong yet again! Surprise surprise! I wonder when he figured out he is on the wrong side of this equation? Must have been the polls and realizing his funding is cut off. However his words are documented calling this smart and two bucks of sanctions became billions!
@dimitrilascaris Canada sanctions Yemen and sells lethal weapons to Saudi. Canada doesn't say boo to Saudi. Because corporate profit is #1 priority of most governments.

@IAPonomarenko The compromise is that they leave Ukraina, give Crimea back to Ukraine, and immediately take any pro-Russian Ukrainians back to Russia so they can live happily under authoritarians and sanctions.  If you want to be Russian, GO TO RUSSIA.
@Independent Oh the bloody irony. This from the country that bombed Raqqa so much that 80% was left uninhabitable and flattened every hospital in the city. The country that invaded Afghanistan, invaded Iraq and uses sanctions to punish the people of off-message nations.
'It is not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It is the customer who pays the wages.' (Henry Ford). Protect your business by saying "NO" to sanctions against your customers in Russia, Iran, PRC, North Korea, Belarus and many of others.

Yall knew what caused WW1. Well outside of the assassination or post assassination the actions was blamed on Germany, sanctions were imposed that crippled the economy. WW2 was on offshoot of that because after years of economic turmoil the people needed a leader to lift them up
