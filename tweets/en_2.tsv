@Acyn Putin would have invaded Ukraine while Trump was President. The COVID19 virus delayed it happening.  Unfortunately for rasPutin, Russian interference in 2020 was fortunately not efective enough for Trump to remain President.
@BarstoolZ @jfslat @Aviation_Intel Very unlikely. Once Putin has pulled the Nuclear Trigger, all bets are off. NATO/EU would be obligated to intervene to protect themselves.  It PROBABLY wouldn‚Äôt result in Nuclear Armageddon, at that point Putin would lose the support of China, and they‚Äôd fold.

@Chellaney I think you are intelligent enough to know that a NATO member putting boots on the ground (or no fly zone) will trigger Putin to escalate this to WW3 and yet you frame it as if it‚Äôs being done to avoid putting ‚Äútheir own citizens in harm‚Äôs way‚Äù. You should do better.

@ClarkeRaodi123 @alisonborealis Actually, they didn't. Anymore than Ukrainians would be said to have chosen Putin if Russia wins the war.

@NikaMelkozerova Because they are obsessed with conquering and VICTORY. Putin hates an idea of free Ukraine, so in his sick mind it‚Äôs quite logical. He must conquer Ukraine and gain another historical victory to strengthen russian national myth about victorious nation. It‚Äôs pathological!
@nytimes @cindygallop It won't be just Ukraine. In the Baltics we are another 6.5 million. Poland 30 million. Belarus 10 million. People think if Ukraine falls then that will be the end of it? Putin wants all. We will have a retardation of Eastern EU States bordering destabilised Ukraine and Belarus.
