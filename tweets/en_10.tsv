2019: *votes in government that has overseen unprecedented and disgraceful rise in homelessness*  2022: "we can't help refugees, what about our own homeless?!"
@adrianjhaigh @danelawdave @sarahja11207317 @SJ141123 all those spouting refugees welcome are welm of living in nice posh homes and wouldn't entertain an imagrant or a refugee living in their home if their street for that matter, all virtue signaling clowns ü§î
At least Ukrainian refugees make it into the country before they‚Äôre faced with some of the issues. Across Europe, vaccine and other covid restrictions are in place. Arriving refugees to Germany for example need to show they‚Äôve been vaccinated, or get one  https://t.co/Yxdq8btYaZ
BBCBreakfast: Brad couldn‚Äôt see his daughter Lowri‚Äôs special night at the Baftas with the team behind Encanto, he‚Äôs currently helping Ukrainian refugees crossing to Moldova.   He tells #BBCBreakfast he‚Äôs ‚Äòso proud' of his daughter.  ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ZReYeAuaP8

@BikerGary17 Men who like frocks and heels don‚Äôt want to fight for their country. Women with cervixes have stayed in Ukraine to fight. Why should a man in a crock be excused his duty. Let others die fighting. Men in frocks don‚Äôt have any children and are not refugees
@bmay Basically, it‚Äôs up to the refugees to find a mean of transport and up to the public to house them. The gov has different priorities by the look of it.
@bmay It‚Äôs all back of a fag packet. Reacting and responding after they realised the misread the room on refugees. https://t.co/HI21nxj40B
@BrushfiresTeam @MakingMoneyFast It was an interesting line of thought worth examining.  We know there's been a plan all along &amp; Ukraine has a history of both invasion &amp; being a nest of vipers.  The Bidens and Nulands are maybe the sacrificial pawns, along with Ukranians; being turned into (surprise!) refugees. https://t.co/besGUIX2FQ
@CairngormMan Blimey that's a bit rich, from someone who thinks some refugees are more deserving than others! Tell me how you know, that those in a boat have not fled some horrible atrocities!
@ClareMSimpson absolutely, I should really change my wording, rather than using the term that is used to divide. Change is possible, look at Germany opening doors to Syrian refugees: so diff. to the 80s/90s when I worked for solicitors representing asylum applications.
Close to 90,000 people across the UK have signed up to welcome Ukrainian refugees into their homes.  At least two MSPs say they've registered - the SNP's Ash Regan and Maggie Chapman from the Scottish Greens.  #CapitalReports https://t.co/7LT6BPRYMM
Could no sleep after hearing the Richie Allen show podcast last night. They were covering potential safeguarding issues, with this artificial push to house refugees. In some countries, child traffickers have already taken advantage. Horrific  https://t.co/abzhqEqOB6
@Country24291070 What sort of country do we live in now where we put filthy dirty scroungers in hotels ...... and   1. Not look after our own people 2. Not able to properly support REAL refugees. These people are really suffering. If anybody dares to mention white privilege again ill deck 'em!!
@DaveKeating For anyone stymied by UK visa bureaucracy, pass the message that Ukrainian refugees can travel freely to Ireland and then enter UK via Northern Ireland without controls.
Dear God.  They've been taken completely by surprise by people's support for Ukr refugees, and haven't given a moment's thought to the practicalities of actually helping ppl. Utter moral vacuums, the lot of them. https://t.co/kbSgGL4igy
Denmark rejects hundreds of Ukrainian refugees at border. If a refugee doesn't have all documents (common for refugees), only wants to transit through or is citizen of another State but fled Ukraine now, get immediately thrown back to Germany. Migr Minister blames "security". -DR https://t.co/O3NznNbSoi
@ecb @Lagarde 2024 or 2025 or 2026?  Resign or Act. #inflation  With millions of refugees what will happen to house prices  if ECB keeps rates low? Raise Rates and stop House prices spiralling out of control.
Every time you hear @BorisJohnson claim that the UK has accepted more refugees than any country in Europe or @michaelgove brag about our ‚Äògenerosity‚Äô it‚Äôs worth showing him figures from the home office https://t.co/DBbvIgqBuM
@FarOutAkhtar @RajkummarRao @bhumipednekar Did you watch The Kashmir Files ?? Do watch it ? And review the film. It shows how some people made some people refugees in their own country.
@GBNEWS Yes. No more Foreign Aid for India, Pakistan or any of the countries that thought it was a good idea for Russia to invade Ukraine. Also deport all the migrants immediately. Charter ferries and take them back to France.  The introduce a properly funded scheme for REAL refugees.

I could take in Ukrainian refugees as I have a big house with three spare bedrooms, but I'm not sure how practical it would be to relocate a family across Europe to deepest darkest North Yorkshire, just to make me feel good about myself. Perhaps I'll do the üü®üü¶ thing instead.

@POTUS How many refugees has USA opened its arms to?  5 ?
@ReaIDonJTrump45 Raise your hand if you believe it's a shame to go on NATIONAL TELEVISION and say you are accepting WAR REFUGEES when you're not. The Romanian consulate told my brother the only way his fiancee could enter the USA with him is if they marry. There is a 90 day wait.

@ZKolesnyk @andersostlund @jonasgahrstore It's too late to "wean off". EU gets almost 100,000 of UA refugees every day. When it becomes 10 or 20 million, will EU be able to handle that? So, economic issues are inevitable, but they decide whether it's by their own choice to stand for their values, or out of cowardice.
