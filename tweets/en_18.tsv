@SophieintVeld @EU_Commission @vonderleyen @eucopresident @EUProsecutor I was skeptical about the possibility of embedding the main position of the UE by rep. Germany was a good idea
By taking a reticent position in defending #Ukraine , the US is strengthening the legitimacy of a militarized EU. We should consider the unintended consequences.

@toryboypierce Another bizarre remoaners assertion.. the left and unions campaigned for years to leave the EU because cheap Labour undermined their position yet somehow its was “right wing” it was always going to lead to more jobs available which equals higher wages and stronger unions

@laurnorman @Amb_Ulyanov Nothing is positive about the JCPOA at the moment. Russia/Iran/China are in a win-win position and the US/UK/Germany/EU are in a lose-lose. No deal is bad, signed deal is worse for everyone not running an authoritarian dictatorship or authoritarian theocracy.

@NiallWarry And yet, he has succeeded in putting UK in a better position than EU to deal with CV19 and has a more coherent approach than USA on Ukraine.  His Achilles heel is decarbonisation: he now needs to learn some biochemistry with the same assiduity he applied to the classics.

@jakub_steiner Putin has no reason to strike them. But war is chaos, lots of things happen unintentionally and accidentally. And I don't think anyone was in doubt about the EU/Western position in Ukraine. So I hope there is indeed a political (and not just emotional) benefit
