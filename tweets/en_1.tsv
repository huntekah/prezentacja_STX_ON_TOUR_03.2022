@Acyn Putin would have invaded Ukraine while Trump was President. The COVID19 virus delayed it happening.  Unfortunately for rasPutin, Russian interference in 2020 was fortunately not efective enough for Trump to remain President.
@badtux99 @MichaelGStefany @JackDetsch @EndGameWW3 Therein lies the problem.  For many Russians, Ukraine *is* part of their own territory.
@BBCr4today @Marthakearney @bbcnickrobinson @BBCr4today Liz Truss comments deeply unhelpful, undermining of Ukraine and counterproductive. She needs to take a lead from people who know better than her, President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people who maintain a positive outlook on negotiations.
@BikerGary17 Men who like frocks and heels don’t want to fight for their country. Women with cervixes have stayed in Ukraine to fight. Why should a man in a crock be excused his duty. Let others die fighting. Men in frocks don’t have any children and are not refugees
@BurgerKing How long you will continue to pay taxes to the bloody PUTIN regime? STOP doing business with killers of children in Ukraine! https://t.co/LdM5wLczm0
@cryptocountings @ArmedForcesUkr Azov is a group of right wing fighters supported by Ukraine. The truth is that just 4% would be very far right which some call nazi. In reality they are fighting for their country and making a difference. Stop the nazi narrative and focus on the bigger picture.
@cvpayne Joe ignores the US. S. Borders illegals &amp; Afghans get US $. War is a waste. Help America. UR vote is to blame. Joe ruining the US, 1 rotten decision after another. Proactive diffuses. Our weak military, blame Joe &amp; Kamala for Ukraine pretending to solve self-created problems.
@_dave_doherty @nastynateman @TulsiGabbard @USArmyReserve Fact sheet released by (DoD) Cooperative Threat Reduction Program which talked about the activities under the Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP) in Ukraine contains statements directly or indirectly confirming the existence of Biolabs in Ukraine. US media- crickets.

Everybody keeps saying that getting rid of the no-fly zone over Ukraine may escalate the war but have you thought about it it also could end it and save lives

@marin_marius_eu @LatestAnonPress If I follow correctly, it's a Palestinian person with their mouth covered, not heard or allowed to be heard by social media or Israel of course. Everyone talks about Ukraine, but not what happens everyday by Israel to Palestinians and has been for years.
@Michelin Dear Sirs! Russia continues to attack civilian population of Ukraine. Every ruble that ends up in russian taxes turns into tears and deaths for Ukrainian children. Stop cooperating with the aggressor! We need your help. Stop the war together. #StopWar #Stoprussia https://t.co/TDDMGR7sc8

@NikaMelkozerova Because they are obsessed with conquering and VICTORY. Putin hates an idea of free Ukraine, so in his sick mind it’s quite logical. He must conquer Ukraine and gain another historical victory to strengthen russian national myth about victorious nation. It’s pathological!
