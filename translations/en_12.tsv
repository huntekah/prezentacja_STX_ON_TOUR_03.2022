😂😂😂❤❤❤🤣🤣🤣 There have been videos of Ukrainian farmers towing away at least 3 tanks (which were in good working condition) using their tractors! 🚜 President Zelensky announced that they could keep them! 😆 https://t.co/EzVgRlWmt9
@7Veritas4 Zelensky is trending near the top of my list right now. He is bravely doing everything to fight for his people.
A month ago it would have been hard to imagine French President Emmanuel Macron trying to copy President Volodymyr Zelensky.  #UkraineWar #Ukraine #UkraineRussianWar #UkraineUnderAttack #RussianArmy #WorldWarIII #StopRussianAggression #Russians  Now it’s the reality we live in. https://t.co/NyjYjVLuJx
@AMHoste @steve_burg1971 @samstreetwrites OK ..... he tried to copy Kennedy last month already, with his 'thoughtful' photo shoot, but now trying to look like Zelensky .... this is just ridiculous.
Analysis: President Zelensky to appeal to Americans as Russia intensifies bombardments https://t.co/mM6Nq7gESA
@Anomander16 @William_Dunn I am no expert on Schroeder, but Zelensky thinks he might be able to help. All nations trade, we give arms, they give us oil etc. I think the heart of the problem is when a leader is in post too long. We had it with Thatcher.  Putin has become arrogant and too powerful.
@BBCr4today @Marthakearney @bbcnickrobinson @BBCr4today Liz Truss comments deeply unhelpful, undermining of Ukraine and counterproductive. She needs to take a lead from people who know better than her, President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people who maintain a positive outlook on negotiations.
@BBCWorld I suppose that at this moment many psychologists and even psychiatrists peered more closely at Zelensky's photo: - What the hell is he talking about ?! And for what, for the sake of a post on Facebook or Instagram?! Really?!
@Bella_Shiraz @KyivIndependent Peace will come when Zelenskyy and Ukrainians love their children more than they hate Russians.  😥😥😥 🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊 #WorldPeace #UkraineRussia #Zelensky #Zelenskyy

@guardian What are your comments on that Zelensky ? ..
https://t.co/ymLc0alMCl  The mission of the “NATO Peacekeeping Force in Ukraine” was approved by the Prime Ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia after the end of talks with Ukrainian President V. Zelensky in Kyiv.  Please repent, accept Jesus Christ's Death!

Leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic &amp; Slovenia are travelling to Kyiv today, to meet with Volodymyr Zelensky, as the fighting continues. https://t.co/m1yVpYuNYJ
@lexfridman @ZelenskyyUa @KremlinRussia_E Putin might come, the bloody psychopath might find it entertaining and get some Love from you. Hopefully, Zelensky has better things to do than explain you "his side of the story" like try to safe almost 1000s of people from town of Mariupol. I am so ashamed I so admired you once
@littlejeff5 @Daniel_Grigg @UKLabour Ahead in the polls and media is giving them an easy ride. When Zelensky and Macron can win from nowhere then this cardboard "LOTO" can too. Western democracy died years ago. All our choices and "freedoms" are tightly controlled and this doesn't exclude the democratic choice
Memo from the office of George Soros:  Hey guys the "Zelensky look" seems to work well on the peasants, try to work it into your routines.  Regards George https://t.co/fVCgxbof17
@MeshDispatch @EndGameWW3 Wishful thinking russia did not even use their  a cards, FOAB, Armata, Tu-160, let alone nukes. Ukraine is winning in twitter yet they are losing territory? Why is zelensky begging for nfl?

"Putin appears locked into his own germ-free isolation chamber, probably worrying that any Russian military officer who comes near may pull a gun on him. Zelensky will be addressing the U.S. Congress virtually."  https://t.co/BkMLOo7BhC

@Ukraine maybe #Zelensky should invade belorus and make ukraine a bigger country
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that his country should accept that it will not become a member of the US-led NATO military alliance, a key Russian concern it used to justify its invasion. https://t.co/iQGmZO3Y3z
@VP I'll be more impressed if you did what the Poland, Czech and Slovenia Prime Ministers did, visit Kyiv to meet with Zelensky
Zelensky could get honorary knighthood for &amp;#39;inspiring leadership&amp;#39; in Ukraine https://t.co/gk2NY212Dl via @MetroUK   Your joking right??????
Zelensky is clearly not interested in nation saving. He is blaming Russia today but not clear about his role in saving Ukraine from total destruction. A globalist image aspirant is what this guy is @ZelenskyyUa under the disguise of a war.  Shame!
Zelensky signed a "countering collaborationism" law banning anyone cooperating with Russia in any way from taking part in politics or government for 15 years, thereby guaranteeing that pro-Russian Ukrainians like Donbas will never allow themselves to be part of a unified Ukraine
