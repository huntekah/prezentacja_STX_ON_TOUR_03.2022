@AndrzejDuda Wisdom is not only a desire to go to Ukraine but also to take care of the nation and immigrants and the armed forces of your country and not just for show. The strength is in the collectiveity of people rather than the unity. Maybe the Ukrainians would start their businesses. It would gain the entire economy.

@NarkunTomasz @otoWojciech @LowBeta2 @tomszl @GPractice @energialehome The condition for such a scenario is only one - the economy will continue to grow as from 2015, where we had a golden period of bloom, and the RPP's rates will decrease again to record low levels that we have seen since 2015. Without this it will be hard.
