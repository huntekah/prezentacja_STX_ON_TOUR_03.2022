@1972tom Going to destroy as they push the law of impunity+, then they will endure the sharpening.
@AdamusCrystyna Sharpening? And what happens in Emergency Room and S.R.S., that's just out of line!!! A friend was with a kid on the weekend... UKRAINES HAVE FIRST... They entered a dozen off the queue before his child was served.
@Andrzej84663920 @MZ_GOV_PL Are there any sharpenings?
@anti_foliar @K_Stanowski Not to calculate whom vaccination helped and who didn't. And the tranquillity of the vaccinated? What would it result from? They can also be infected and wear masks and apply them - a few more - sharpenings. It would be proud to claim that if I vaccinated myself, I am safe.
@Antisyst Yes for two months as sharpenings for two weeks... .
@ARMY2510 @KonradBerkowicz Imagine that yes, only I sit in the UK. Since they endured the sharpening was 30-40k a day. Since the mainstream only war and not covid, now it is 70-80k a day and it must be emphasized that there are 3xless tests a day. People stopped caring because there is no TV anymore.

Covid's flirt in the shadow of war @KlaraKlinger https://t.co/r4aXFvBSNB
@Damor of sharpening and consistency in them in Poland is a joke
@DariuszSzumilo All countries are getting better and better, but according to what some people think they've lived better with masks and sharpenings. People stop this bullshit and take care of your own lives.
@docent_ws @adas_torun As I wrote back elsewhere, many countries had significant omicron sharpenings. They fall from a high horse. We with a pony . Our conversions of pro-growth factors are relatively small to changes in those countries.
@DrBurska Yes, they suffer because they flee the war. I really distinguish it from the idiotic ideas of our politicians. All covid sharpening should be long over for everyone.
@FckPutn505375 @Sebull22 @CONFEDERATION_ @a_Sunday It doesn't justify that we have to fuck around in masks and test ourselves. Since power has come to this, it is necessary to remove the sharpenings of all and not to deepen the divisions between people!
@goldenhabitlou Want to extend the sharpening until March 31st and the concert is 30
@han_marry_me Only America, and thirdly there is covid and the lightest sharpens are in America
@hockeygoaliepl actually we have a 2 year anniversary as they introduced the first "observation":). At 15 cases
The Netherlands: The royal family broke anticovid sharpenings. Several dozens of people played at the birthday of the princess EURACTIV Poland https://t.co/13WkyU7U2A
@Jacek_1R @si_bonsi_bon @niezaleznapl Meaning how @Niedzielski keeps sharpening for Poles and for Ukrainians it doesn't work directly against Article 32 of the Constitution, and geniuses throw out Polish students from the Internet to make a place, it's not a Canadian combat tactic. I'm starting to lose myself in these hangovers.
@JanSzwarzek @gromotpl @RuchOsmiuStars @KuceOf No very well Grzesiu called the session abusing the pseudonymous PlanDemi somehow 2 million Ukrainians let in without vaccinations without tests without anything and Sunday this criminal says that because of the refugees of the sharpening for Poles you will become Wisiec as Poland will return ^_^
END OF PANDEMIA IN POLAND? Government endures all sharpening #msnpl https://t.co/sKrV5Sr2m1
@KonradBerkowicz won't go. Polish children are thrown out of boarding school because for the sake of a place needed.
@Korabita @Michal007l @KsKneblewski This is not about sequencing Ukrainians but about the same treatment of us and it is high time to put up with idiotic sharpenings like other countries
@Kozlowski_Jerzy @K_Stanowski Don't the questions raised by the editor of Warzecha deserve an answer? Do we have a pandemic or don't we have a pandemic? Are they sharpened or not?
The Kremlin abolishes all COVID-related sharpenings. Except for security measures protecting the criminal Putin. https://t.co/lR2FijY996
@maciej_star @davoff994_d We already had sharpenings for 2 weeks... now 40 PLN for 2 months. How long will it last for 2 months?
@mariushho Totally right. With the pandemic, however, over time more and more people came together, that every next wave had already had smaller sharpenings (we remember hell March-April 2020), so I hope that now will be the same, that in time people will become wise.
@mateusz_p1991 2 years old I was kicked out for these fucked-up sharpenings, and even more so on drugs. I got sick, I went through covid like the flu and I got super. Why the fuck this shit?
@Maya_1952 @MSmolanska The fact that there are more bandits in the world is not an argument. However, it is not true, look at Sweden as light sharpeners and as few deaths.
@MBalawelder but what are you doing with this #pis? Just thanks to @pisorgpl our sharpenings were the softest in civilized Europe! If they ruled "there" it would have been, including the obligation to vaccinate.
You think the covid sharpening's gonna come back?
@MZ_GOV_PL A do you count Ukrainians or just Poles? Poles are now a worse breed in their country. Ukrainians Covid19 does not apply and sharpen them too.
@MZ_GOV_PL Why are the sharpenings not lifted for everyone?. I understand the situation in Ukraine, but either the sharpenings are for everyone or for nobody. For 2 years, scaring people like a virus And then 1.5 million people can cross the border without problems. Mati has a business plan
@MZ_GOV_PL How many confirmed cases are there among refugees and refugees? Aren't they subject to tests? Nobody's sharpenings apply anymore? Or just a selective part of citizens?
The "panlandemia" has still not been called off, Poles are restricted, and Ukrainians are not affected by any sharpening. What the hell is going on here?
@Nlikenoon But I bet when they open and take off all the sharpenings it will be such a boom tourists that the massacre... I wonder how the Sobies can handle it... They can take off the sharpening gradually, but still...
A new variant of Coronavirus already in Europe. Belgium: A package of raw materials. A new sharpening of Radio Zet https://t.co/QtEXi3zz7K
Since March 18, the UK has abolished all the bindings associated with entering the country in order to cross borders it is necessary to have only a valid identity document. And in PL Pan @a_Niedzielski continues in its artificially inflatable
From Friday 18 March, the United Kingdom has abolished any covid sharpenings that apply when entering the country! https://t.co/TBBS2vaXVg
From Friday 4am. any sharpenings to the entrance to the UK are abolished. For pure Blood also. And Acosta and Sunday from the covid mafia probably get sewn passion. Tens of thousands of Poles will be able to travel quietly to Easter. https://t.co/l2Ozxs2cHQ
Officially, the Bavarian government confirmed that the restrictions on the capacity of stadiums cease to apply on 19 March. Thus, on Saturday's Bayern match with Union Berlin, 75 024 viewers will be able to sit at the stadium! [BR24] https://t.co/X1ignkvRpN!
@ohydek_crazy @JS_Kxz @mefistofelleess @Ankapitalism A please, the Prime Minister comes out, I admit to the mistake, any sharpening disappears and the minister responsible for this follows the suggestions of one of the members of the Confederacy.
@Less @PatrykSlowik Today it is the drooling weapon for UKR, the severity of sanctions, the humanitarian bridge with NATO guarantees, taking the wounded for treatment to Europe. The removal of people from at least 4 towns. Political and economic sharpening for Russia to get into trouble faster. Getting ready for ..
@Pak0__0 @LadySaniaWWWW @Patryk35443374 @FckPutn505375 @CONFEDERATION_ @a_Niedzielski I don't think so, since they are released from quarantine https://t.co/tElqh962eD., and then, already in our country, they are not affected by their sharpening. Polish doctors are still released, and the tickets for lack of masks are probably issued. I don't know, I'm not in Poland.
@Mrs._Scarlett But apart from the conf, they all supported and even demanded more sharpening. I don't think I would write stupidly. Besides, it's the WIS that went crazy? See what sharpening was in Germany or France. You're right that the WIS makes mistakes, but when I look at others, what would rule us, it.
@PetrusdeCorona @JolekHihot @Marcin_K5 @Grzegor55127426 Politicians prevented the most normal economic development. And now you see in England additional sharpenings when Boris was caught at a party while others were in lockdown. Our elite was also playing and for her there was no covida. Only a gray man exposed.
@PioSzlachtowicz Even WB and Ireland have already abolished the sharpening, and onionand as usual operates in a different dimension
@placzekgrzegorz @MZ_GOV_PL @a_Niedzielski @MorawieckiM It's easy! Vaccines do not protect against diseases. The situation improves by complying with DDM+W principles and lockdowns introduced boldly and absolutely by the Government https://t.co/ROYBh45m2N
@PolsatNewsPL @MZ_GOV_PL ...and now yak!!!...2 million, or three million unattended refugees. And who's gonna bounce for it? - POLICE! Because it's gonna be someone who's gonna impose health warnings on us again.
@PosrodWierszy @presidentpl Maski wore practically in every country, currently covid in Poland has been treated like any other flu that is why they are drawn sharpens;_; in China even before the pandemic everyone who was cold dressed a mask out of respect for the other so that they do not infect him e.g. on the subway #
@potas1982 @JKlimasara Yes, if this is a problem with a narrow group of panicners and does not affect my life by e.g. Sharpening it yes, for me there is no and I am happy with this fact:) It is only a pity that quarantine is no longer possible for a runaway because at 8zl per litre I would sit at home:)

Find everything and replace the sharpenings, enough.
@YourPolandAnon As far as the genre in China is concerned, then we end the war again with a novice, tightening the fuck up that with vaccines and driving with the circus all over again.

There will always be an argument to introduce a new dose, new sharpenings and new certificates, and each year they will somehow contain more and more information. Now we have to inoculate and introduce masks, because to Poland the deadly Ukrainians immigrated
They've changed the perimeter.
@zolty26 @RioT_PL and now you have some sharpenings, maybe outside the masks in closed places? IMO time to stop measuring the number of bans, focus on hospitalizations and start treating covida as a heavier flu strain
