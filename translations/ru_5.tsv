@aanechaev If inflation fucks up, the surest way to turn money into fantasies
@AkordaPress is about these messages, messages, statements, if they're not in the paper they're written on? Why did he say after the tragic events of January that he had raised citizens' incomes, contained inflation, and strengthened the national currency?
@Aleks_Hit @63Kostas Hidden Inflation is a black wound and lack of products on the market.
@Aleks_Hit @Iv1911 was also inflation in the USSR.
@Aleks_Hit Inflation was, but it's not visible, I remember an article in a comblestone about it, a woman with a shirt price tag in ten years.
@Aleks_Hit Inflation was, wasn't talked about, and prices were kept administrative, with total deficits and everything, and prices were, of course, raised from time to time at the request of the workers.
@Aleks_Hit Inflation was expressed in increasing the time that had to be spent in the lines to boil down this ruble.
@Aleks_Hit In different ways at different times, there was a decrease in Stalin during the rest of the world, and in the newspapers it was easy to find the orders online. Inflation was a famous example of vodka. Less known about the value of coffee and gasoline in 1978. And construction material in 1983. Children's clothing and D.D. To Gorbach! https://t.co/E6CAFchiwQ
@Basist69 @rupisec I thought it was like, after the Tranzite was sold, it was like no legs, the money ate inflation, then it seemed like nothing was working, and now it's getting used to something on the electrician, it's on the route or the taxi, and then it's like moving, and it's shorter than not yet with the wheels, and I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.

@FonokR @Aleks_Hit Now inflation and deficit. Proved to the Russian Federation.
@future_is_mow @romaZhu isn't all so straightforward... inflation, like already two-digit
@Garik70574750 The EU and the U.S., other countries don't do that either, and since inflation around the world is getting more expensive, everyone's trying for their own countries, who's better off selling cheap when everything's better.
Infa z bunker Putin was darkened by 2 events!!!!! ? - The pre-BEC report of the Russian-Nabiulli inflation at the end of the year 69-72% inflation is one of the main features of the economy and living standards in the country, with Putin's understanding of inflation 70 percent was very sad.
@major659 @pevchikh thank you, most citizens with 20k wages and inflation (beginning to hyper) will certainly be able to buy a 27k puff, much less 46!

@PinmeUA Annual inflation in the US has already been 6.2%, the highest since 1982
@probus01 @Djeihunbek Inflation in the U.S. is unprecedented, and will be even higher. If QE is down, and the stakes are up, all mortgage programs will go down, and everyone lives in debt, because the stakes were low, so that's the end of the sale and the start of the recession.
@prof_preobr cicio will write inflation in a month of 1.07%.
@prof_preobr do not forget that inflation is now worldwide.
@prokopishko @vasti_news disagrees, and flows can change, but you have to look at what flows, it's like manufacturing technology in Asia, too, and it's a matter of benefits, but on the other hand, inflation isn't really critical, those who are transnational, it's like a sore.
