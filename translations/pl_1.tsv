#Pandemia has prepared us for the crisis management that we are dealing with at the influx of patients from Ukraine's war-war, calms the Minister of Health @a_Niedzielski. #Ukraine #Ukraine https://t.co/io3JaVEy5q
Russia would like to reach an agreement with Ukraine to ensure that generations live in peace, the Advisor to Putin Miedinski.
From hospitals I have information that among accepted citizens #Ukraine the level of SARS-CoV-2 infection is about 30%. However, I assure you that we do not see a risk of a sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, says Minister @a_Niedzielski. https://t.co/mroLaS3BCR
@AgaBak You wondered why none of Ukraine's neighbours except Poland went to Kiev? Slovaks, Romanians or Hungarians representatives are not there. No normal person who directly borders with Ukraine takes such risks.

@Andrzej31263190 why ue and nato do not go to Ukraine only all wails to Poland and murders I spat and shit they do just watch people die and Ukraine stays in ruins
@AndrzejDuda @ZelenskyUa Not everyone cares about Ukraine
@AnnaSiarkowska Because even from propaganda trends/trends you can sense something After all, no one tells you to like it or give it further A propaganda is on both sides I even Ukraine in this field wins crushingly
@AnnaZalewskaMEP @EmmanuelMacron @OlafScholz Babo z magla. It's just PR this visit doesn't change anything. Ukraine needs to defend the closure of the sky and stop financing Russia by purchasing coal gas, through Poland goes a huge amount of goods to Russia and nothing Poland does with it
@A_Traczyk Some of you think that Russia is pressed against the wall but it is not. Ukraine has already spoken that it does not want NATO which cannot help. The Union will not accept Ukraine and have already shown it well. Ukraine has already won the united nation. Horse territorial for Russia will.
What is the source of the strength of Ukrainian society and state against Russian aggression? There are many factors, rarely the one of key importance - a system based on self-government, self-organization and decentralisation. More in #Antimatrix @Policyka_pl
Can the war in #Ukraine mean a biological threat? Prof. Krzysztof Pyrć @k_pyrc explains the difference between research laboratories working with biological material and the work on biological weapons.

The story has taught us nothing. Kaczyński felt like Piłsudski, but luckily he doesn't decide what NATO will do. And the rest of Europe doesn't care what happens to Ukraine, they don't limit them, so they can do whatever they want and threaten Putin with a finger.

IMHO @GiertychRoman is right. If there was no agreement that the prime ministers represent the EU, the discussion of the Delgation Mandate weakens and does not strengthen the pronunciation of this visit. Ukraine needs solidarity at every level today. https://t.co/3XprVXBSPG
Why do you think @Anna_Mierzynska left out a thread of the forecasts of the impact of refugees on health care or the availability of apartments for students in large cities?

According to the Ukrainian Parliament, President Złenski has signed a law that cannot justify or deny the ongoing military invasion of Ukraine https://t.co/KyXWC8Bl1m in the media since 2014
@JarekkRights @DBrzezicka @mymis97 @MorawieckiM Probably bought these surfaces for longer, and the bulb has become a little out of date because Ukraine wants to do this mean Union, and Poles support Ukraine, so there is an excellent opportunity to tape it with a "current" message.
@Karol_t_sz @TheCejrowski In the case of Ukraine, someone has not completed the formalities the question why? After all, Ukraine has aspirations to belong to the European Union and NATO, so much so the UN did not? Find out who screwed it up because innocent people are dying and Putin still thinks Ukraine is a Russian zone.
Lavrov-"hope for a possible compromise with Ukraine" ,I think they get their ass kicked and the blockade is tightened on the throat of the Soviets
We have on Twitter 22,000 Polish accounts created only to make it harder to fight against the pandemic, promoting Sputnik, attacking Poland as a community, and for a month it has been switched to attacks on Polish-Ukraine relations. It cannot be blocked or silenced. https://t.co/ZXW5z1QiCa
@MarcinPrzybylek similarly bite several years ago on Lech Kaczynski, similarly enjoyed his death. Such people are mental Soviets, they can even for fashion "solidarize with Ukraine," but it is Putinist pushover

The only solution would be no fly wife over Western Ukraine, but in NATO, or rather in WH nobody has the balls for it, and in the vicinity of Biden there are also no advisors with a cold war experience... That's the only thing that would stop Putin
@MorawieckiM And I don't think you're pushing your talking and trying to show how wonderful this Poland is. NATO says that Ukraine won't close space for us and Kaczynski says to close the sky partially in Ukraine. Laughter in the hall.
@MOstafinska @GenapiMa @BartSienkiewicz Tusk and Macron consider that creating a T-shirt and a beard on Zalensky will wash off your friendship with Putin and selling weapons to Russia despite the embargo imposed in 2014. This weapon is now used in the war.This weapon kills! This is "legality" in the EU! https://t.co/YLGZ83TzWM

@Pawel_T___5 @wkurxxPolka It will increase if your representatives do not know what you will be able to draw the attention of the aggressor to the areas adjacent to Ukraine. Good war is better for some than uncertain choices.
@pawelw86 @HowIt really is @MichalMurgrab These are real refugees of war with different traumas. Besides, this is how we build future relationships with free Ukraine.
@pisorgpl @MorawieckiM Interesting You refer to the words of LK, who spoke in Georgia that the next one will be Ukraine You say that you warned from Putin for a long time And yet warned in XI2022 about the potential attack, you say that 20 days ago you did not take it seriously and the scale of aggression surprised you?
After your mouth you can see (mind on your face) that you're not clueless, this trip will yield in some time, but it must be understood, Ukraine is not a land 200m X 200m, it's a granary of Europe and sesame natural resources. Such beets will never keep up with PJK. You can only listen to tedious Germans and Moskali. https://t.co/ZVX14CiF4b

A large group of journalists writes that the visit of JK and @MorawieckiM in Kiev is an important gesture. Maybe so. The problem is that Ukraine and Zełeński already have enough gestures and after the bow. Ukraine needs actions, because the time of gestures has passed.

@SteelFec @wsti17 1: "Our Ukraine," i.e. the exchange of government, the embodiment to the Russian Mira. 3: Connection with the Transnistria, maybe Moldova, because I don't remember this from the left coast of Ukraine. There is a hull without significant resources and access to the sea, which capitulates in exchange for 10 years of existence.
@Szjadczak Ukrainians want weapons, they want truck blockades passing through PL to BY and RUS, they want to close the sky to d Ukraine, they want safety and not sleep on the floor at the station because the government forgot to send transfers to local governments. They don't need empty promises. https://t.co/GtgGTWiGWO
This is no different from the transport of AKs and representatives of the underground state by NKWD https://t.co/NqeAsoo7RH in 1944-1945
It is not NATO, but the UN can " close" the sky over Ukraine. It is, in my opinion, impossible. China and Russia are also part of the UN. This possibility must be expressed by 100% of the UN countries. This was, for example, the case in Libya.
