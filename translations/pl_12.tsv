Ukrainian President Wołodymyr Złenski signed a law prohibiting the preparation and dissemination of information promoting the activities of the Russian Federation.
What if this "conflict" is also directed?You can't forget his role in the 2015 national service.The production tells the history of the history teacher from Ukraine, of course Złenski), who unexpectedly pursues a career in politics and becomes president. https://t.co/ju9KGH4ogz
@adik_81 I bet the latter. I hope the Ukrainians are reasonable enough that the President Zelenski will not accept them personally wherever it is.
@AgaBak The undeniable fact is that Putin caused the war, not Zelenski. It would be logical to put pressure on the aggressor, not the victim. Similarly, PMM can send a note with the words of support for Kiev.
@AnFor10 @TygodnikNIE O Zelenski as a black hahahaha. Double standards have comrade in relation to this war. What do you now pay Putin? https://t.co/jdGCEl7Ikt
"Anna-Maria Żukowska" #Levica - commented on the post. The content: "Zelenski has no interest in doing this. He has an interest in having as many allies as possible regarding Ukraine's accession to the EU.
@A_Traczyk I think it will be a little different. Politically Ukraine will pursue the EU, but will resign from NATO, as Złenski has already announced. Territorially recognizes the annexation of Crimea, but will regain control of Lugansk and/or Donetsk. And the key question - what about the reparations.
@beatamk Husband of Zelenski and the other. https://t.co/CiYlawtaTn
@beatamk Right, Złenski definitely statesman. Does Kaczyński have short pants I don't know, you can't see in the picture.
Will they know where Zelenski is? https://t.co/r2t8XEcgEB
@BiblioUkasz @katarinaa @KownackiBartosz is doing sessions alla Żełeński, but in a direct meeting with the original it will appear that Macron is just imitation.
@BielanskiPawel @lkwarzecha Żelenski will do anything to spread war on NATO. He will even talk nonsense about Smolensk
@bweglarczyk I assure everyone that Żelenski knows exactly what" caliber" are these people and what they mean to the Polish people. It is difficult to say that in European relations they play any role.
@CezaryFaber -Amb. Mosbacher suggests it -prez. Złenski knows -wicepremier Rogozin admits it Let it say gray Kowalski, this "worse sort" will challenge him from the cracks.
@ciahol Zelenski as Duda https://t.co/u2vFrtIQdF
As for J. Kaczyński's visit and appeal, the initiative of Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers was, by Ukraine, received as a positive gesture of moral support about which President Złenski spoke. 1/ #warjanaUkraine #RussiaInvadedUkraine #warina https://t.co/NtBZQbpNK1
Is it just me that for a psychorighteous person, visiting Kiev is an opportunity to beat up Tusk? Żelenski certainly expects such help in the first place
@Dariuszwierc1 @lkwarzecha People of ice take it cool. You really believed the Ukrainian message about the weak Russian army. It's complete nonsense, understand it at last. If it's so weak, then why is it moving forward. Then why does Zelenski want help? People are going around a little bit.
The former first hero of Georgia, a former member of the globalist salons of Saakashvili, is currently serving prison sentences in Georgia. Time will show where in a few years there will be another warlord of globalists from #ThePermanentWar; Zelenski. https://t.co/GxcVrWxrMC https://t.co/sXjWCCKfg
@EwaZamojska hope they do not track #Zelenski after this setup
@goltarr After all, it is Złenski who came to Poland, the Arlams will now go to the flagships from Polin.
@humancent_ipad @TygodnikNIE deserved for yesterday's trip. Żeleński praises, You spit: https://t.co/2Re8gBpsIX
According to the Ukrainian Parliament, President Złenski has signed a law that cannot justify or deny the ongoing military invasion of Ukraine https://t.co/KyXWC8Bl1m in the media since 2014
@jbart_xy Żelenski said Read On Friday And if you don't learn, learn from the works of Antoni Maciarewicz If it doesn't satisfy your desire for knowledge, then Jarek's speeches are made during the months.
@jbrudzinski Who do you want to do? After all, Tusk, Sikorski, Komorowski but also Czarzasty, Biedron, Kosiniak with Kamysz... they are all in one party - Politicians against Poland and Poles. You know that well. And Zelenski? How can a comedian know something about Smolensk !?
@jbrudzinski This is President Złenski who knows anything about this? Can you know how he got this knowledge? And he hasn't shared it with us so far?
If Europe does not take a position now, Russia will target other European countries. We are all Russia's target," said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Złenski https://t.co/DWPeG9I9aC
@Jolanta6Jolanta @WoogieBoogie07 What Zelenski does now I fully admire and support.
@Jovita77732510 @Wodzimi39911944 Which after some agreement of the EP, if Zelenski did not want to meet someone like that.
@KaziSmolinski @AndrzejDuda Kaz, your band is a copy of one Russia Putin and Żyrynowski's PLD, urizarists + Grunwald's patriotic union. You wanted a division of Ukraine, but Zełeński crucified your plans.
@kejtrouge Such a bit of a clinging to force. For example - Zełeński also spoke about fellow nations when he encouraged the Russians to protest and assured them that they had no and no bad plans for Russia.
@KoneserUnion Zelenski says: the mother-boo who sent me here...
@KonradPiasecki Ta and carries weapons, medications and himself will stand on the barricade. I think Mr. President Zełeński would prefer to hear specifics online.
@Zelenskie Levacation has no interest in doing this. It has an interest in having as many allies as possible about Ukraine's accession to the EU.
@lkwarzecha Do you have access to the details of the conversation? Zełeński informed you? Or did Morawiecki report to you as soon as he got back? Humility would be expected to hold back with opinions on topics of which you have no idea.
@lukaszb99 @PiotrWiel Ech! Or maybe they would have stayed in this Ukraine. Zelenski will give them some work. Then the guarding will be easier.
Macro wanna be like Zełeński xD elite force xD 2700km from danger zone xD #Macron https://t.co/AuClBUSnwk
@MateuszPluta02 @LechuLechuLechu Because if we are based on Macierewicz's speculations and his pseudo committee which explained as much as nothing is bravo:) the fact that Zełeńskiă who is a hero of the people of Ukraine ) speaks of Smoleńsk that something could have happened, the simple question why he has such information ?
@m_gdula Yes. Złenski has nothing to do but take delegations.
@Micha75365527 @MarzenaBula @TygodnikNIE taaaaa... Zełenski lives only by assassination in Smolensk... and has his advisor -&gt; Antka
@michaldworczyk @pisorgpl @MorawieckiM Just a moment, and you will be so quick that you will find that it is not Zelenski and the Ukrainians bravely fight Russia, only the old fart from Nowogrodzka.
@micheleshurstor Zelenski has a war on his head, true - praises everyone, rightly - only in the Polish media looks hook if he praises only Duda
@MirekRazanski No , only Żeleński and really the Lord, could benefit from and keep silent on these matters. https://t.co/0WqKa3KVvV
This can be compared to a situation where Zelenski would go to fight on the front himself. A cool symbol, but what's the stakes?
@MSWiA_GOV_PL @shefernaker @Radio__Plus Zełeński patted his back and those so excited. Make Ukraine Great Again. https://t.co/7cFbrBQZwK
@MUrsynski @PiotrMuller And how is it that Żeleński is still alive even though the hangovers are trying to kill him? They just can't and have no balls.
I think so: Okay. They went to support. Praiseworthy, only that you could also clearly and clearly support in the media. Honestly and with affection, then show the deed done, what we actually did. And this deed done damn well misses me. Zelenski is not a fool.
By the way: - in Ukraine, abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy is available on request, - if there are additional conditions, pregnancy may also be interrupted later, - Złenski is a proponent of further attenuation of the anti-abortion law. https://t.co/bVzktrRe9
Unfortunately, the embarrassing Zelenski must, instead of Kiev, stare at https://t.co/kgnAWuGVIH
@NightZ Złenski and four dwarfs!
2. Make accelerated elections in Poland 3. Pis 3 term 4. Destroy the EU. 5. Baltic countries under the patronage of Russia. https://t.co/Im53nvQpnS
@OgiliusOggy imho after all on a symbolic-propagand level is extremely important. Zelenski is doing a great job on the front of building national unity and gaining support of the West and such an action in a bombarded Kiev meeting with EU representatives is a big support in this field
"We remember the terrible tragedy in Smolensk in 2010. We remember how the circumstances of this catastrophe were investigated. We know what it meant for you to silence those who knew everything exactly, but they were still looking at our neighbour." /W. Złenski/ A ONECH ZACH. https://t.co/ChD5oeBCpQ
@PiotrMuller There is no evidence that Żeleński was not in Poland. (JKM)
@Piotr_Schramm Smolensk 2.0 free us from the writing dictatorship, Zelenski sits in a bunker far from Kiev.
@piotrugg Is it true that J. Kaczyński, M. Morawiecki, W. Zełeński, D. Szmyhal are the same nationality?
"We need reliable security guarantees that will suit both us and the international community" #Ukraine #NATO #Defence24 https://t.co/6xOScVKHTH
President Złenski said that 'the negotiating positions sound more realistic', while the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says (in the RBC) that talks 'for obvious reasons are not easy, but there is hope for compromise'.
@profMarekBelka I rather fear that Żeleński will be in greater danger by this visit.

@SamselMarcin It was evident that Złenski was not particularly impressed with this visit. He behaved as always exemplaryly, but without undue eloquence. He also watched to keep the pictures on the sidelines.
A large group of journalists writes that the visit of JK and @MorawieckiM in Kiev is an important gesture. Maybe so. The problem is that Ukraine and Zełeński already have enough gestures and after the bow. Ukraine needs actions, because the time of gestures has passed.
@Szjadczak @BMikolajewska Jizas...
@Szjadczak @BMikolajewska Żeleński fighting for Ukraine does not have to worry about triggering armed conflict Russia- NATO. And you can even understand it. You can enjoy even symbolic benefits for Ukraine after this departure and expose Kaczyński's intention.

@tterlikowski Cheap PR performance for reptile - Marine and Viktor's friends are on their way, Vladimir's friends at the same time! We are going to elections, what, writers? Złenski was in the parliament of GB through the links, tomorrow he will be in the US Congress... without unnecessary drama - he has enough on the spot.
@Tulayev Żeleński should kick his ass in front of everyone for fraternizing with Putin-Orban, Salvinim and Le Pen cones
@WarNewsPL1 Z? Żełeński?
@Werny_Hora @BMikolajewska @EreaAndrzej No because Zelenski thinks differently than you.
@WoogieBoogie07 @Jolanta6Jolanta Zelenski is a Żyman, our first lady. And I think all Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs.
All global media are reporting about the expedition. Złenski himself asks that the next politicians come to Kiev, the more, the better. But no. Our experts know that it was a failure and a waste of time for Ukraine.
