@AgaHerrmann Pis does not steal the uterine-positive Ukrainians to give them to Germany.What you do is anti-Polish activity, Refugees is gold. Don't forget.
@Alternativy__4 War but there are places where they give food for refugees. Help is not that every refugee will go to a restaurant or shop and take everything for free. That's how it doesn't work and I see from the kindness of Poles is used we teach them that they are free to do anything.
@ArturKey We agree that it would be good to have better data. Sweden is a golden standard. But labour migrants and refugees are two different groups. Migrants do not need significant support - they go to work and they can count on shelter. Taking them is much easier than refugees.

@cvbxin congratulations. but I assure you that your desire to learn at least the basics of the refugee language, to help this refugee (and soon a representative of a huge national minority in this country) will do a lot of good. Especially that I can see from your profile that you are solidarity with the Ukrainians??? https://t.co/KoteJ6ute2
Giving fish is just a stage of feeding an extremely hungry person, then you give her a fishing rod and she not only becomes self-contained, it can become part of something in common. Refugees from Ukraine need help, not charity. They want to work, not be dependent. /6

@drMarcinWalas Everything will work out - it takes time. Refugees are safe with us, they have a roof over their head, they are not starving. They must be patient. Waiting for PESEL is not the worst thing that has happened to them lately.

Today, in the TOK FM interviewing Dr. X, he was surprised that refugees before the aggression of Russia - a country without three divisions of authorities, go to Poland, also without three divisions of authorities.
@Firarafaa Of course, but with our management abilities it is rather a dream than reality. I think we have to be realistic unless there is a total tick, Russia will no longer leave Ukraine and the refugees will stay with us for years and why the children are guilty, let them train, enjoy...
@Flyboy_Pete Different cars have refugees. Btw do not know if these cars have arrived in Poland before.

@Gotowalska @katarinaa Especially in the face of a war in which people die, natural growth is very important. It makes sense for logic (simple) but that's not what refugees need right now.

@JablonskiArek @GiertychRoman Polish aircraft for Ukraine - This is not the decision of Poland The provision of the European Convention on Human Rights - incompatible with the Polish Constitution according to the Polish Constitution Refugees on the Belarusian border - Polish case. Russian trucks on the Belarusian border - Let the EU make decisions.
Why do you think @Anna_Mierzynska left out there a thread of the forecasts of the impact of refugees on health care or the availability of apartments for students in large cities? Anyone who talks about this "sews Russian content"?! #Ukraine #refugees #war #warnaukrain #Russia #Putin https://t.co/uxtbcHgDcW
@Karol03134963 They have no arguments because they decide international law, not political propaganda. For example, in Italy refugees cease to be refugees (they are in the first safe country, e.g. in Poland), and they become illegal migrants if they do not have a residence visa.
@Klubnauer Such "privileged" are given to displaced persons rather than refugees.
@KrocpokZboj @Bob_Gedron Are the trains to Kiev? Then why did these refugees walk to the border?
@Ludwik_Peziol @TonyMulligataw1 @MichalMurgrab but in practice it looks like refugees have already received powerful privileges, you can already hear the first reports of preferential treatment in hospitals and schools.
The place of refugees is in the refugee camp https://t.co/lRg83fJqxM

They do not want to be a burden to anyone, they want to be useful. Refugees from Ukraine are trying to help local governments who have accepted them. In Radna, in the commune of Tarnów, the Ukrainians support the activities of the local Cultural Centre. Read more https://t.co/2hLMhf6hRo https://t.co/F9LXoqgc1N

Since March 16, refugees can apply for a PESEL number. Why? To take a job, rent an apartment simply, formally start a life. In Sosnowiec we have launched a special point. In the parking lot our guests fill out a print, take a photo at one of the points, and in the UM there is registration. https://t.co/faSKnO375x
From now on, refugees can apply for the number PESEL https://t.co/rlWzib1wBS
From Wednesday 16 March, refugees from Ukraine will be able to apply for a PESEL number. https://t.co/xsREDqbNQ9

They are only going there to return as refugees and gain new privileges. Interestingly, like the Poles returning to the country, they will also have quarantine.A pity that OPIS did not compete so as to protect Poles from pandemic terrorism. Was there any intervention in this matter? https://t.co/O7Vzerz4MC
@PabloMo09825801 Technical question: Warsaw - Kiev (in room conditions) The fastest route - car 10h, by train more than 20h. Refugees say it takes a week to reach the Polish border.
@panzer_in 1959 @DariusDaretski @gazeta_election In the first days of the war, war refugees from Ukraine arrived and what did the Jews do? Jews accepted and the others turned back.
@pawelw86 @HowIt really is @MichalMurgrab These are real refugees of war with different traumas. Besides, this is how we build future relationships with free Ukraine.

@PiotrMuller So you can officially announce the start of the election campaign in PL. In your little senses, you're still wondering how to do it here so that refugees with PESEL can vote for you.
The Polish state will spend PLN 2.4 billion on benefits for people who help escape Ukrainians from the war. This is the result of the impact assessment of the regulation coming into force today. #Ukraine #war #HelpForUkraine https://t.co/ZR56UtDDk7

@WTumanowicz And where were we when refugees from Syria and other countries came to Europe? I am surprised that Europe wants to help us at all.
@WTumanowicz Without exaggeration. They accepted other "refugees" so we wouldn't have to. Know Ukrainians a completely different fairy tale because first of all they are real refugees whereas Germany simply doesn't have room for dirty people.
