@ABridgen @joerichlaw Unfortunately, Covid restrictions didn‚Äôt quite destroy all small businesses, as the government had hoped, so extra measures must now be taken.
At least Ukrainian refugees make it into the country before they‚Äôre faced with some of the issues. Across Europe, vaccine and other covid restrictions are in place. Arriving refugees to Germany for example need to show they‚Äôve been vaccinated, or get one  https://t.co/Yxdq8btYaZ
@Ayrhead2 @mattventisei Me? No way! What I am saying is that having ineffective restrictions is worse than having none at all. If restrictions are to work the need to be robust &amp; enforced to work . This part time mask wearing is not a health decision but a political statement.
#BREAKING As the Omicron variant of the coronavirus appeared more contagious and less lethal, several Western countries, where cases have been falling in recent weeks, decided to lift their restrictions.

@DowdEdward Millennials were advocating for restrictions, distance, masks, tests.   Boomers advocated for hair cuts.  They just don‚Äôt care how many had to die as long as they have their conveniences
@dr_musgrave Personally I'd change destinations, the more people who do this and hit the economies of the countries imposing these rules the better.  Is it any suprise all the destinations removing restrictions have seen massive increases in bookings.

For two years of pandemic basically nobody from my family or research group got COVID19. One month ago the Swiss government lifted almost all restrictions and - surprise! - basically everyone of these persons has now gotten infected. The power of public health policies! üá®üá≠‚ò£Ô∏èüëçüèº

@godyoongicult theyre talking of changing restrictions but also they've been having a whole week straight of over 300K cases daily and the highest daily death toll since the beginning.
@goldentrout10 @JackPosobiec I understand where you're coming from. It was a weird time when this first started. I will say that this interpretation of "liberty" is a bit of a stretch. The restrictions were put in place to keep us healthy and safe. Right wing media pushed a narrative that...

@HowManyMiles_ @Jen4Scot @parkplacecove I am not saying there's  evidence against..but there is recent evidence they don't make so much difference as advocates assume. And questions around(given 3 months now of lighter restrictions in England) the reality of cases  so much higher in Scotland, are reasonable &amp; valid?

@ladymissazira Does that work, though? Or is it like parliamentary privilege where it only applies to MPs in the chamber, and outsiders' discussion is still subject to ordinary restrictions

@ProcessNamed To be fair, there is much less urgency now that we have found out we can go through an omicron wave almost without restrictions, I'd bet there would be more pressure to deliver if the threat was more serious. Important to have something ready for the autumn though

Re-implementation of restrictions would do fuck-all to stop the spread of an airborne virus that travels through animal populations.
