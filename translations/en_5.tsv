Fuel could rise as high as ¬£2.50/L for petrol according to experts. These absolutely criminal price rises come while companies make record profits.

Fwiw: A big part of narrative on CB credibility in this post-Covid era is actually fuelled by factors *beyond* CB control. It's like farmers being blamed for weather volatility.  A simple, recent, example is oil volatility over the last 3 weeks. Very different inflation scenarios

IT Firms  1% higher onsite wage inflation could lead to a 30bps margin drag  Travel cost used to range between 2-3% of sales, dropped to 0.5% to 0.9% of sales during covid.   If it increases back to precovid levels margin could be hit by 40-100 bps  Overall impact 70-130bps

@JohnM53093509 @ThomasSowell Supply and demand is not inflation, that's only price increases.  Inflation causes money to have less spending power over the entire economy and not just one one good that's in short supply.

@PramilaJayapal We need to stop talking about a $15 minimum wage. The fight for 15 started in 2011. You're asking for a fair wage based on inflation from 11 years ago, and you're likely to get a compromise on that. Set the bar higher. If you want real change you need a max or proportional wage.
