â–¸ Russia has long blackmailed the EU with energy supply. However, refusing Russian oil and gas will be less expensive to Europe than considering the European Negotiation Position to be more powerful than it is to use it to achieve peace at https://t.co/LwflPUrC #StopRussia https:///t.co/6Nfz5oi6F8
@MirAckerman@laugh_in_pain @oleh_kurza If they are required to participate in Canada, the EU, Taiwan, Japan, etc., it will be stronger than anything else.

In social media, there is a favorite game of the ZRIRA Ukrainians. We are formally not members of NATO, but we are now deeply integrated in its structure. Therefore there will be no single agreement of the Greens or Group Council on terms of peace, and there will be a joint position between Ukraine, the United States, Britain, and the EU.

I correctly understand that people who don't like the position of Israel and some countries in the EU, and people who are completely fine with the behavior of Germany, Arsestovic, Permissive, DBR and other passions (set it up, because I can't see) are all the same people?
