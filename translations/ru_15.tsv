@alexrooland @elenash0500 No matter how much they give, the power crisis has caused such a rift that it will be free before the end of the year. The power puss bubble is about to burst, as long as it doesn't suffocate from this stink and disease.

@HistoryFooto E? And the movie Zorro's Badge is also involved? And the entire Latin alphabet. The genre crisis, gentlemen of the odor, the creative is coming to an end, probably with fear.

@kommersant What crisis in Ukraine? This has nothing to do with the death of Major General Mariupol?
@kzrtsv and why are you so surprised, people might have the same idea in their minds that Lukashenko is good, and a cost-effective crisis is bad.

If the Russian government fails to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, the war will continue for years and the experience of Afghanistan will repeat. The West will not leave Ukraine without weapons. Death weapons will enter and Russia will lose much.@KremlinRussia @KremlinRussia_E

About the fact that Ukrzalyznya started to nationalize more than 3,000 Russian wagons. Here, the RZD will just say thank you very much. There's no way that cars can be written off - a crisis of overproduction. And now you can spend money with a clean soul.
No, well, temporarily it's a fact as if just the crisis of the '90s and 2008s was also a temporary question, just how long did it last?
