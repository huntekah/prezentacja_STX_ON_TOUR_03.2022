@Adam70274280 @REVOtoja @Vegeta91SM 2/2 and if most are simply selling images under money, then the rules are set in advance. The same in LoLu - you want skin, pay - you have skin. Otherwise if you give the possibility of staking, they support some ecosystem, they are made under the community of a given krypto who understands it.
@Albert301271 We are intruders in our own country, and it will be even worse, as long as their crypto-consciouss rule our country...Their lawyers trained for our money will judge us, and the cops will crawl... and then you will be seriously welcome to Ukraine...
@ari10com again wasted hour is getting ready:) ladies you have to start by entering what promised the world goes forward binance in a moment will take over the entire market just creating bridges Fiat krypto success :)

@cryptoawos @Mikey_Satoshi @profMarekBelka I don't know, but I suspect that many voters can because of their age, do not completely grasp what a krypto is.
@cryptoawos @profMarekBelka let's be realistic...who following the crypto would really go to the elections at all and vote for you, whose name is one of the taxes:) P.S. I miss the elections in the country where you run for yourself, or vote that your aunt doesn't win them.
@cryptoawos @profMarekBelka Belka is a bankster, there's no wonder he doesn't like the crypto.
@cryptoawos @profMarekBelka Was this vote only about BTC ban or all krypto?
@cryptoawos @profMarekBelka I don't like M.Belka- but what you write about saving lives by crypto is very far-fetched. Life saves vest, medicine, etc. And no, they're not bought for crypto, only for fiats obtained from selling crypto. Find where you can pay for vests via BTC?
@cryptoawos @profMarekBelka probably gave the captors and offended by krypto
@cryptoawos @profMarekBelka This is an overinterpretation with the AU. This gentleman may simply not grasp the crypto and believe in foolishness. Or he doesn't like the fact that he can't get this biscojna into the vault with a paddle so if he doesn't have it nobody will...

Does Pierre Gasly have a vibe type who at parties tell everyone why it's worth investing in krypto
So there's a probability that some Americans who don't have a krypto yet will buy. It's estimated that only 16% have bought now. And this is a very large market and deep in $ https://t.co/tnGmyp5JtB
@Davey18027504 Yes. Let's hope they don't pick up and print further udd. For krypto and sp500 it would be a big benefit, otherwise there might be inheritances.

@DigInvestor @Konrad12627538 @Grochu_M @rabal_zaorski Shouldn't it be so that the money from the krypto sails to the payment of installments? (People will have to sell the krypto to pay off the payments from the crydite?) If so it doesn't work for me then correct me
For governments, keeping values in krypto is not new. So far we had: diamonds, gold, silver, art - it was all there and it is not to keep the FIAT at home - why do you think?
Good material. Welcome to view and comment. #Kryptoekipa #crypto #crypto https://t.co/Ni0cZD7dWj
@DoctorWar It's kind of like with bitcoin, everyone knows about it, part of it is interested, it's less speculating but when it hits 60k udd it can even read about it in a box or rumor because everyone suddenly becomes a big investor and an expert in krypto.
Good morning. We're starting live cycles. Today we present morning coffee meetings about krypto always at 10 am. I'll let you know which day we're seeing each other. Please continue. #bitcoin #etheum #LiveStream #crypto https://t.co/gNawcR6IWk

@ElectricalLuk @Adrian84862537 @piotr_rataj so, adjustments on American stock exchanges can last up to 6-7 months. Bessa looks different, often flat in the first 3 months (I'm not talking about krypto, which is more shocking) There is a possibility that we are in the late stage of correction.
@GieldyKrypto is missing because he was making kyc aml and wanted to be legit... so he was punished by real crypto-boys. You want to make kfc aml verification regulations... think twice, sad gentlemen don't fuck because they're fucking regulations.
@GolaBartek @harros20 Colleagues know what to invest in now? Krypto or physical gold? !!1x
@GrabkaStaszek @GildyKrypto What nonsense. Regulations are the only future of the crypt. You have to live in a cave so you don't know where institutional adoption is going.
@GrabkaStashek @GieldyKrypto No and what you're talking about is changing rapidly. Barter exchanges in krypto can and can be centered, private, etc. but how you want to connect permanently Bitcoin, Ethereum or other protocols to traditional finance, without regulation will not matter, amen.
@hevitheknee In a system like in crypt exchanges, that a camera photo with a document held is needed easily bypass?

@kopaczpl1 @CezaryGraf Don't forget about the breakdown of the euro yet, as he claimed the euro would fall like an old woman. This time the eurasa almost 5pln. Krypto the same. And I was going to buy from a year ago from this obsessive and intrusive consultation. Graf thank God that I changed my mind in time.

@LewiczMichal @0xKubi I'm not surprised you had that thought too because it's the biggest mystery of the krypto world so far.
@lukasz21377 @piotr_rataj @Adrian84862537 Although I am a bear, I also try to keep in mind that ATH "EUFORII" on the crypt in this cycle we had in May 2021, since then it has been 306 days. In the previous clink we had a hole after 346 days from ATH. Also you can slowly start DCA.

@MichaelPeanut1 Buy a crypt or toilet paper.
@MKonspirator @cryptoawos Translates to people for a long time that krypto very easily block just update the routers of the main manufacturers Cisco and Huawei. If at least 1 krypto element is blocked the transaction will be failed and the krypto does not exist. Of course no one believes me;)

@PiotrOstapowicz Only 4 months in krypto and 1 time patiently wait for fall (count on Fed)
@PiotrOstapowicz I'm new to krypto. Ask better coinpanda or blockfolio for wallet monitoring?
@piotr_rataj I often give my unfortunately non-optimistic opinion to the aggression of "investors" whose capital in krypto does not exceed $1,000.
@piotr_rataj @Kuba50029015 I was also a little disappointed, but I think patience will pay here. It is a bankster krypto that will discover its price in full adoption. For November they announce "big bang" so I hope that at least a little smile will appear on our faces
@piotr_rataj Yes, but the krypto market was a different fairy tale, as if only 5 years of difference but the changes have been colossal.
@piotr_rataj Most of the krypto from 2017-2018 had no coverage in the final product. Now I think we stand a little bit on a different level and projects that offer some product, have ecosystems on which real applications are built, will continue with us.

@correct2 @Marcin_K5 Let's start with the fact that there is no more such thing as MY... walk around Szczecin, see more, look at the young people 18+... and about the so-called Polish State I won't even mention...The elites of the authorities are all Jewish banders, crypto-hooks and sabasgoi... So I ask who is MY ?
@profMarekBelka is a "Lord," with a beautiful Ukrainian flag on a profile that votes against POW, and as we know both Ukraine in hard times highly praises crypto space, but at the same time it is a rescue for an ordinary citizen to escape inflation. Mark the hypocrite!!!
@rafal_zaorski What responses do you anticipate on the crypt market after raising your feet?
@rabal_zaorski @uknf Do you still have any Krypto positions?
@ravmaz92 @GieldyKrypto This goes on living there, it doesn't have to be a regulation to trade krypto. Krypto doesn't have to have any regulations to grow well-the community decides what will be and what will not be and not the regulator... if regulations will carry positive things together it's the most
@ravmaz92 @GieldyKrypto Everything can be bypassed, just remember that institutions want to use new technologies and it is in their interest and not in our... krypto is not from adapting. The future is one of good friendly positive regulations or lack of them.
