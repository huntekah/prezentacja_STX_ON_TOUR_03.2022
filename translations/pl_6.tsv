@AnnaSiarkowska And now let's go back to the ground, oil dropped by about 20%,$ 6%. When prices fall at the fuel stations and will lotus lower artificially excessive refinery margin? Let's leave historical evaluation to the next generation
The price at @PKN_ORLEN as during the first days of the war. This is how you make up for the reduction of the vat. Fuck @pisorgpl @MorawieckiM and all the rest of the proputinist band.
The barrel of oil before the start of the war was less than $100, currently a little over $100. Dollar rate jumped from around 4.10 to 4.30. The current growth of the barrel and the dollar is around 5%. Anyone want to tell me what else affects that the prices on the stations are about 25% higher?
$98 barrel of oil, $4.28. How's it going? Fuel has already gone below 6 PLN ? @DanielBajtek @PKN_ORLEN
The barrel fell below $100, dollar 4.3, and fuel prices still record, but now Lorlen will earn... https://t.co/QZFXHlkKam
@bjgabris @Lagosz_Krzyszto is interesting for you to count, if you drop by twenty more per cent and the dollar by a few per cent, we should pay less than PLN 4 per litre.
@bozenalisowska A was then a war of stupid cunt and $5 each?
@bozenalisowska A dollar PO how much was !?
@bozenalisowska A dollar PO how much was a woman?
@bozenalisowska And how much is a dollar now? And how much was it then?
@bozenalisowska And how much is a dollar now? To be credible it is appropriate to write it, not to rub it.
@bozenalisowska And what a dollar it was then, you buy oil in zlotys, what an indifference and ignorance of our pseudoelite. #RussiaOnuca
@bozenalisowska and how much did the dollar cost then? the entrepreneur and does not know that the oil price depends on https://t.co/KtABvTX3cx on the dollar rate?!!!!
@bozenalisowska And after what was the dollar?
@bozenalisowska and how much was the dollar then?
@bozenalisowska A how much is today's dollar?
@bozenalisowska But the dollar was 2.8 zł, today 4.3zł 108x2.8=302 , 108x4.3=464. 50% more costs a barrel of oil today.
@Bozenalisowska BUM! The calculations are carried out in USD, how much was 1 dollar then and how much today? Are you going to start thinking, or are you only able to practice dull propaganda?
@Bozenalisian Economist... and she's heard of something like a dollar?
@bozenalisowska How much did Mrs. @bozenalisowska's dollar cost? BUM!
@Bozenalisian rate zł to dollar 1= 3,37 currently 1 dollar =4,70. Plus war and economic and beyond our borders in Ukraine , Who chose you as a councilman ?Prettyly deceived voters by pretending to be wise . Or manipulator great with you .
@Bozenalisowska fucking price of dollars and inflation, stupid fucking also occupation that there are still dickheads in the world who catch such populist fucking
@bozenalisowska Not that I am defending the government. I am far from it, but do you consider that $12.08.2021 cost PLN 2.86?
The @bozenalisian councilwoman, where did you come from, the Economist of seven pains, and how much was the dollar, and how much is it?
Brent under 100 USD and USD after 4,305 PLN. At the top of the oil cost more than 130 USD and USD 4,62 PLN. https://t.co/aON2xAneXo
@C_Kazymirczak On the black market $200 rubles. Officially approx. 110.
@CobraBarrister Dollar for bread is a European price
@damianst79 @UOKiKgovPL Dollar is no longer "roady" - he made a roll from 4.6 to 4.3 so we have a few extra % in reserve. With these dividends there may be something on, such a bag just in case. All the more so that our companies do not buy only WTI/brent but also buy crude urals. And this one is cheaper
@DanielBoth Barrel under $100 ,a dollar on a fixed level and this one leaves that will lower by 20 gr pb ,you think you have people for idiots?
@Daniel Obajtek when did your company stop thieving on Polish drivers? Oil and dollar down and fuel at stations for a few pennies moved? And don't you think that people are losers for whom you have us with your intellectually impaired click.
@DanielObajtek Oil at $103/bar, dollar falls and you $7.55 for ON openly doing people in the ear, ordinary thieves you are, country robs its own citizens!!!!!
@DanielBajtek is how did it go with this reduction, currently oil brent at $100.72 per barrel of dollars after 4.29zl stealing from Poles continue?
The forecast from 16.03.2022 Historical start of the monetary restriction process by the FED is bad news for the US dollar. Most of the positives have already been included in its quotations and USD index remains only... https://t.co/I94sirIKQ7 https://t.co/IzE5B41Ayb
The dollar costs at the beginning of Tuesday's session of PLN 4,3016. The decline in interim inflation https://t.co/NrotnZ99j4 https://t.co/H2JK6INy6M
The dollar didn't jump up (nothing he didn't do before) and steadily, slowly falling. Not what Putin expected. I think even China slightly surprised, hence their yesterday's message about Ukraine. https://t.co/vxXiHUwOVI
@DushanZ 24.02 dollars 413-ON 5.50 - barrel 95.87 07.03 dollars 4.61-ON 7.99 - barrel 129.44 15.03 dollars 4.29-ON 7.69 - barrel 101,12 Increase to price from the day of the outbreak of the war USD by 12% to 4% now Barrel by 35% to 6% now Price on station by 46% to 40% now Still want to discuss ?
@E_Rafalska The announcement of Kaczyński's visit to Ukraine strengthened the ruble. https://t.co/JxgmwgeGJC
@FXMAGpl Dollar still high
@gnetowisk @GrzegorzKastner @JacekTyszkiewi1 @SlawomirNitras As you've already operated the USD, see how much the dollar cost.
@GregTyminski @piotr_rataj From what I've noticed, BTC draws the reverse graph to the dollar index. Now the dollar is at the top of the bar. I bet it won't last long there and will start downhill. So it turns out that the battleship now counts its low valuations.
Hello, Mr. @Daniel Obajtek, Mr. @MorawieckiM barrel of oil reached the price from before the start of the war of $100. Dollar is 4,3 PLN before 24.02 was 4 PLN and gas prices at stations somehow did not fall at as fast as they grew!! Someone is cheating someone!!
Indexes down, goods down, crypto down, dollar down. How do I live? https://t.co/m0PQO1Q2N3
@JackGadzinowski @UOKiKgovPL Apparently this is their plan to save inflation. The margin from 4usd to 30usd/bbl. It seems that the profits of government companies more important than inflation and wallets of Poles. Even the translation that the dollar of the road will not help. The price chart of brent oil per PLN shows the truth - we have the price 15.02 https://t.co/fR220SqdVf
@KaziSmolinski @PKN_ORLEN Just announced when the barrel and dollar fell?
@KaziSmolinski @PKN_ORLEN Barylka at $129 at $4.60 - price $7zl at $4.30, a barrel at 100. A decrease in the barrel by 22 percent of the dollar by more than 6 percent.
Each dollar invested in ecosystems can give up to $30 economic profit. #ReGeneration #GenerationRestoration https://t.co/0taoakLFiT
@KrzysztofOmny @Michal7PL @AdamFabian85 Exactly... The price of franchise is an increase of 90% and the gas by several hundred.

The euro rate remained close to PLN 4.70. The US dollar costs less than PLN 4.30. https://t.co/42tMx7RMXl

Sales rates of the main currencies on Tuesday (15.03.2022) morning:
The exchange rates are falling. #Euro is more than 30 gr cheaper than in the gold sale apogee. #Frank is valued at 4.55 and #dollar at 4.28 zł. Reflection #PLN goes hand in hand with a marked increase in global stock markets and a tightening of oil prices.•https://t.co/UyAUXk6SOe https://t.co/7C1NeLM0Km
The exchange rates started last week with the declines, the euro rate trumps last week's hole, dollar and franc give the box https://t.co/NjWtbyOo5U https://t.co/5VDplnoIOT
@limba22 @JakubKuras3 @DanielJob @PKN_ORLEN How much is this dollar jumped? Today the dollar is +8.8% than a month ago. What k...in a miracle of 5.5 you...baoo at 8zl? 6zl this should be max
@LozaGdanska A dollar up or down for two weeks?
@LozaGdansk World Currency is based on gold, a dollar on oil! This is the whole puzzle. https://t.co/LQyYx13utJ
@MaciejWasilews2 @DanielObajtek @mario76wawpl Type not that I would defend. But logically in 2012 the dollar cost max. 3.5 zł Today costs in kidnappings up to 4.5 zł.
@mareksniezko Still a dollar is worth 30 cents more than a month ago.
@OAnalytics @Macronextcom Dollar on 5 flies
Mr. @Daniel Obajtek the price of oil on the stock exchange fell by 35%...and you at the stations the price of ON by 35 cents or 6%. I remind you that the dollar also down. We are well looted.
@Piechocinski To be precise, oil from the summit dropped 24%, USD 7%.
@Piechocinski @lis_tomash Hands fall on people like you who don't know about math. If the price of the barrel falls by 50% and the dollar also by 50% does this mean that oil on the station will be free????? And such people rule the Polish, Zenada...
@PiotrOstapowicz Is today after an increase of stop by fed dollar to pln will strengthen ?
@PKN_ORLEN @DanielObajtek ask both why prices are still as high as the barrel price reached the price before the war, and the dollar also went down
After several dozen market hours of stabilization, the #euro took off from the barrier 4.80 zł, significantly deepened the declines and recorded minims in the area 4.71 zł.
@ProfessorStepien @DanielObajtek Zieeew. The dollar has not yet returned to the pre-war course.
@P_W_Kuczynski Another day of such declines and the price of oil on the markets will be like before the war of the Ros-Ukr. dollar only a little more expensive (about 10 %). The fuel price should be max 6 PLN per ON!!!
@P_W_Kuczynski It's like in this meme - running a gas station is easy: as oil and dollar goes up, you raise the price as oil and dollar falls, you raise the price:)
Oil $97, $4.29. How's the fuel prices at the stations? Next after 7.80? How oil and dollar hurried it up in two days.
100-dollar oil, 4.3-dollar oil, and more or less the same on the stations.
@RS01489987 @michaprzylak @DanielObajtek No dollar fell sharply. Besides, in this calculation the dollar rate is also included dumb.

@RzecznikORLEN @PKN_ORLEN The oil of $99 was 135 in peaks where fuel prices went 80zł per day up, the dollar fell, and with us a reduction of 34gr where is any logic here?
@The bulldozer2 And that's what it's all about, so that the dollar isn't a settlement currency. The Chinese have been testing Juan's electronics for a long time. Once that happens, the US will sink completely.
So I'd like to ask, if compared to last week, the oil went down by over 20%, the dollar dropped by almost 6%, did you at the gas station danced about 25%...for a friend of mine I ask
Last week, the dollar cost more than 150 rubles, and today the US currency is paid little less. Some analysts expect prices more than 170 rubles soon. https://t.co/AQfv7qrvSj https://t.co/7zlo4BKID
I see that the oil is already $95 per barrel, the dollar has also sunk up to PLN 4.3/$ and the fuel prices at @PKN_ORLEN stations are still high. Mr. President @DanielBoytek when you plan a decisive reduction?
@WuPio @unveilNEWS Dollar and Euro too? Because they have a dollar rate and haven't changed.
The announcement of Kaczyński's visit to Ukraine strengthened the ruble. https://t.co/JxgmwgeGJC
I would like to point out that the price of oil on the board fell to $97, which is $2 short than 24.02. Unfortunately, the dollar is more expensive but we are waiting for Mr. @Daniel Obajtek's movement
