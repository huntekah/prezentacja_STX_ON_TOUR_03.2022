By #Green on the train, the premieres of #Slovenich, #Chechia and #Poland arrived. Maybe the most Ukrainian leader from Poland was brought to #Ukraine to show the people, because his video from #Kiev is becoming more and more similar to the editing, or perhaps the old good tradition decided to participate in the section of the country https://t.co/8laBG5Y4jZ.
@360tv Zelensky takes on too much that his position is not a good idea. He has repeatedly stated his intention to sit down at the negotiating table, but he has never been able to sit down. It is simply that the limit of confidence in him has been exhausted.
@Asya39424068 @ilya_shepelin The whole problem is that the presidents didn't want to solve the Donbas problem Poroshenko made money, Zelensky didn't know what he was doing.
@batiscafcusto @riabreakingnews ♪ in his repertoire. There is no reason to demand the demilitarization of the Russian Federation — this is a situation in Ukraine now that Zelensky decides how to give up the country to him, but no, the anonym of "Onegin" "treba"
@bryhynets Zelensky can't pronounce Russia's word as aggressor, and we're waiting for the VR to recognize the path of war criminal and Zelensky to sign it?
CNN: The U.S. Congress and Zelena appealed to the Biden administration for assistance in transferring Soviet-made heavy weapons to Ukraine.
@Elturs @rianru i mean Zelensky does not act on Byden's instructions? I don't think he knows what's going on in his country at all.
@fagidragon @Elenalexy Zathalin banned all attempts on Hitler.
@forest_diver @mironov_fm @altered_cabron, but I don't believe that you're from Ukraine. People are killed with their noses not choosing help. Do you think Zelensky just so publicly thanked her? He's just smart enough to realize that Putodian power is going to collapse if people from the system run off mass, even if it's for shelter.

@mediazzona Zelena... which isn't a statement, I'd like to ask what he smokes, but really, or according to his press conferences, he's turned to alcohol.
Why didn't you keep quiet for eight years when there was more war on the DLR than now? Why don't you say that Zelensky was wrong, although it was Ukr that the government bombed the DLR? I'm against the war, but Ukr's government isn't sacred and you have to accept it.

Vladiemir Zelensky stated that he was abolishing the masking regime in all areas of Ukraine except those that had been paid for.
"Vladiemir Zelensky has signed a law prohibiting the production and dissemination of information products aimed at promoting the actions of the aggressor State", says a communication from the Ukrainian Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy in Telegram Channel.
Vladimir Zelensky what you're signing isn't gonna touch those who live in your country. They're gonna live where they're better off than waiting for criminal prosecution. Russia hasn't started these aggressive actions.

Zelena said that Ukraine in NATO is not waiting, as far as I understand it, for the people to hold a referendum on entering, NATO, Rada must legalize everything and apply, but this is after the war. Now, to stop the bloodshed, the President of Ukraine is ready to accept neutrality.
So, the premieres of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia have successfully left Ukraine, and there is no photo from Kiev (e.g. against the background of Zelensky's office) and it is very likely that they have not been there.
Cornienko reported that Zelensky had signed the Colaborant Act, and that there was a list of 10+ Nardeps that fell under it, and that they would sit there for 15 years or be rotten in a can where they would be eaten by crazy orchards.
And by the way, V and Z are like, "Vladiemir of Zelensky."

Because it's unbelievable to call on some countries to recognize the country as a terrorist, it's above all the rules of political law and peace, and Vladimir Zelensky signed a law on the prohibition of claiming and proving that Russia is not an aggressor in the war in Ukraine.
Ukraine, bombs on the coast of Odessa, sirens in Kiev, Zelensky refuses NATO, but Putin still doesn't show Ukraine that he respects everyone.
Ukraine, Zelensky: "Now negotiations with Russia are more realistic" : shiploads bombard Odessa and Mariupol, showing Ukraine that they respect everyone.
Dude doesn't really like it. Being so stubborn. We already have one. Alexey, Zelensky is on the move, and he's on the move, and he doesn't want to go to NATO, and the EU is critical of weakness.
