1969 - Conflict over Ussuri: several hundred Chinese and Soviet soldiers were killed in the second border battle in 13 days.
@1972tom Oj Tomś , Tomś , you know that Russia's conflict with NATO is a matter of months more than years . I know we only fight for Poland , then drive brave man and see it with your own eyes , there in Ukraine .
@1985Pawe @KonradPiasecki Unfortunately I know that. However, I will risk that this conflict can end China's strong political response.

2. The invented and blown-up conflict between Norris and Ricciardo. The specialty of the bet, which means we're going to come up with some kind of car fight in McLaren. In addition, the wind-up waving Lando in Monaco. Awfully big minus this season, there were so many threads that they could let it go.
What if this "conflict" is also directed?You can't forget his role in the 2015 national service.The production tells the history of the history teacher from Ukraine, of course Złenski), who unexpectedly pursues a career in politics and becomes president. https://t.co/ju9KGH4ogz
@adamhaertle This little leprechaun better stay away and don't talk. In the end, it will get us into conflict, whether it's today or tomorrow...
@AgnieszkaO2GA Duck went crazy. After all, Putin caused this conflict because Ukraine wanted NATO. And the agreement with the US was clear. Belarus and Ukraine will not be in NATO.
@Alease0046685 @radiohed4 In 2014 Russia caused a conflict and now also
In 2017, at the Warsaw Security Forum he said that "Ukraine is a frozen conflict." In 2015 he talked about "the Ukrainian mission of General Hodges" and independent American activity in the region, without NATO's consent. https://t.co/0VpqM0aWmH
@AndrzejDuda There will be photos in uniforms and vests - the posts will go up... Smarty. What if their transport hits the bullet? Armed conflict is ready - brainless!
@AndrzejDuda It's time to open your eyes and not look at Zelensky through an emotional prism that Ukraine is at war. You don't need to be extremely intelligent to notice Ukraine's desire to drag Poland into this whole conflict. Wake up
@AndrzejDuda @michaldworczyk Stop dragging Poland into conflict with Russia, because NATO tells Poland to agree everything with NATO, so do not go beyond NATO alliance
@AndrzejDuda Prez.Żelynski has a problem. To accept people who do not have an EU mandate for this visit? To be accused of legitimizing people who secretly supported Russia? Or to oppose the Prime Minister of a country whose citizens are helping his country? A tragic conflict.
@AnnaSiarkowska @Agiewillow As well as the fact that Polish soldiers will probably die for Ukraine. This is not our war and nothing to do with it. It is necessary to support them, but to stay away and prepare Poland for a possible conflict.
@AnnaSiarkowska Where will you run away with your children as Kaczyński drags us into conflict, Israel?
@AnnaSiarkowska So far Jarosław knows how to promote himself before the forthcoming parliamentary elections. It is a nice gesture of zero importance. Unfortunately, Poland is unable to decide whether the EU or NATO are involved in this conflict - although it may be better...
@ArturooArtur Definitely sanctions. We are not prepared for an acute NATO response or conflict. Now is the war of Ukraine-Russia. Question who and on which side would join if NATO actually reacted harshly?
@BartosiakJacek @Arek_Stankowski @goltarr If there is a conflict with Russia, there is a good chance that Germany will block supplies. Then Baltic control will be necessary.
Bloomberg: The EU has a reason to refrain from the economists. punishing Poland by the rule of law mechanism. The conflict with UKR has affected the status of PL and its role in international talks. The nation has grown into one of the major economic critics of the EU's approach to RUS. https://t.co/vVbXD6XU2l
Do you think Pinocchio and the president would go to a war-raised region without Putin's consent?
@CPB_Dominik @niewienski51 It was once on TT that Marcel was willing to try and put the staff above the conflict. He said no. You're not surprised that one can be over the conflict and choose to play together even? One could even get in the back of the game... as always - details.
@DanielzWarsaw @Langert15 @tvn24 The problem is that there is no such thing as NATO peace mission.
@darquu @RozekTom @ibimspl And I am not surprised by the jugs that will bother even armed conflict, because someone will write that on the Internet.
@David56643913 @wszewko The Ukrainian-Russian War is a proxy war between NATO and Russia. If it lasts longer, we may have a conflict à la Syria in the middle of Europe. Only on a larger scale and "radiation."
Buildings of the Bielsko-Bialski Sport and Recreation Centre in Bielsko-Biała were laundered before noon. Since December, employees have been discussing wage increases involving the city authorities https://t.co/rBB0vnnAzi
Today in Brussels, the extraordinary meeting of defense ministers @NATO is our duty to defend our allies so that the conflict does not escalate beyond the borders of Ukraine, says @jensstoltenberg •we will continue to support Ukraine's defence capabilities @SecDef https://t.co/U4sdZialz
@EckHalina Besides, they are not going to "align the conflict" but to score points, i.e. to wave a conference against the background of the bombarded monument, to bounce the smoke of Ukrainian gratitude for another "gift." I am sure it will work not only on their followers, but also on the "center electorate."
@EdoMarcin @Annabel40505189 They're not admitting anything. They're provoking, they're trying to get us into conflict.
@e_pjoter @karol_plewa @waski96 First, Ukraine is not in NATO. Secondly, we are not in any military alliance with them, which obliges us to join the military in this conflict. Thirdly, I will no longer write because it is like throwing peas against the wall.
@EwaLTIkoI'm asking So now they're whining and trying to create a global conflict, delaying the bankruptcy of their own dollar-based system. Ukraine has been a vassal state to the United States since Obama, then Bidet was his deputy.
@FAKT24PL I protest against Poland's involvement in the conflict Russia - Ukraine! We will die like the other Kaczynski!
@flaywiduo @KrzysztofNowakT @MorawieckiM @P_Fiala @JJJansaSDS @ZelenskyUa @Denys_Shmyhal What is the political effect of the idiot? Conflict was resolved thanks to the actions of President Sarkozi of France. Kaczyński flew to the rally when everything in Moscow was settled. https://t.co/NYU4ayUGam
A fragment of a geopolitical intellectual feast involving an expert in experimental preparations by Piotr Rubas:The war is a set-up of members of a Jewish sect who pretend to be fighting each other.The conflict is a sham because soldiers were previously mutilated with biocidal vaccines on both sides at C-19 https://t.co/fi8k5tA3Lb
@gosiab Yes, because it was too long under Putin's regime.They will be cleaning up at home for a long time to get rid of the Russians.You're right nobody knows at 100pro, but remember that Russian has always been little, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Georgia, Kuryl Islands-there the conflict has not been resolved with Japan
In March there will be a buzz on the plus. I wonder what it would look like without an anti-inflationary shield. For this purpose, an inflation target of 2.5%. An average private company after such mistakes by the president would quickly thank for cooperation https://t.co/BxWzVuut0Z
@gw_1990 I do not share this optimism. Meeting only with Zełęński alone will not change anything and no advantage will come to anyone except symbolic support of him. To end the conflict, they should meet Putin and negotiate some post-war plan.
@HoliBtc @MarcinWenus @xtbpl @uknf and sure, and I'm not ashamed at least I know what I'm talking about because I see a conflict of interest broker - client.. example @xtbpl in this respect is classic how to buy influencers to cover the subject of deviant under the carpet.. but TJS remembers and will not forget :) essa selling lamuses
@Int_Events I protest against Poland's involvement in the conflict Russia - Ukraine! We will die like the other Kaczyński!
@IpnarTomasz @lis_tomasz This is a statement from 31.01.2008, the conflict in Georgia erupted at night from August 7th to August 8th 2008. I understand that you hate your eyes and your senses obscure, but you have to lie. But whatever, the followers of the writing will not understand and you will not get to reasonable people anyway.
@JachiraKlaudia Well that they are going??? They do you as they please! In gray. They go for support posts. Photos from war. Pathetic. By the way tempt fate... Some bauble, some fire (for Putin) and armed conflict ready!!!!
@Jatuoment @CezaryFaber @Rogozin Ty may not, I also believe that EVERY conflict is unnecessary. But the comparison of these two wars, which have the same motive to increase their influence), shows what propaganda and hypocrisy surrounds us in the media. U.S. aggression is good and we send our troops and Russia - evil
@jbrudzinski @lis_tomasz I will remind you, we have 2022r. we live here and now, the armed conflict behind our eastern border continues. You rule 7 years and what the fruits are in the international arena. Instead of writing this nonsense think about what our place in the EU and the world is! propaganda has short legs!
@JNizinkiewicz ..and give Russia an excellent opportunity to provoke. And then, downhill, NATO got involved directly in a conflict in the area where Russia is conducting an intervention.
@catarinaa @CobraBarrister If they were wise, they would: - break ties with proputinist parties in Europe - they would end the conflict with the EU - they started treating the war in Ukraine as a problem that Poland must face together and not as a source of political gold
@KaziSmolinski The perfect chance to drag Poland into an open armed conflict
@KoltonRoman This is some attempt to drag Poland into conflict with Russia, and I remind you of the baubles already hit 20km. from Poland...
@KonradPiasecki Great idea. Put the security of the country in jeopardy for PR. You know that Kiev is in the war zone and if they get shot at, they dragged it into Poland and maybe the whole of Europe into armed conflict?
@KrystPawlowicz @MorawieckiM You could go this conflict would end immediately.
@SlawomirMentzen @K_Stanowski Of course you don't need it. I just gave an example of double standards on my hand. As for the substance, I don't really agree, because it should be our biggest concern that this war doesn't turn into (even) a bigger conflict, because we are next in line.
@lisieckipawel The Polish state's reason is not to support Putin with cash and supplies of the army. It is also not a Polish reason for the state's costly conflict with the EU and attempt to smash it from the inside. Skrutin's election campaign with stupid, non-gesting gestures is also not a Polish reason for the state. Don't you get it?
@lis_tomasz They would have to close the conflict with the EU and it doesn't look like it. They have too much behind their ears to let go of the courts.
@LukaszKohut If you want, go to Ukraine and fight. Do not drag Poland into this conflict.
@LukaszKohut I do not think this is a good change.More and more we enter into conflict with Russia, and the wounded bear is very dangerous!In the event of armed conflict Poland vs. Russia, the prosperity we have built with the canopy for 30 years, will be wasted and we will return to square one!
It's easy to write about supposed courage, it's a little harder to hunt people with a rifle in their hand when grenades are whispering over their head. It's a remark to everyone who would love to involve us in the Ukrainian conflict. Until recently, most of you have shit out of fear of seeing a man without a mask.
@MaciejPasawski @Exen @Kardon1986_2 nobody will go fighting in Ukraine because each country knows that it would be a NATO conflict with Russia on a large scale
@MaciejRPawlicki You are all guided by what the media will sell you. Every variant is possible because we do not know what the globalists have planned. We had two years of artificially created chaos. Have you forgotten? The virus died day by day and replaced it with a conflict that works the same way every day.
@Marekwalkuski @Reuters So they escalate conflict and count on the larger number of Ukrainians killed
@Matt30491354 @lkwarzecha I must admit that this conflict has made me aware of one thing. In Poland, half of the population are men and after the speeches it is possible to assume that there are pussies living here.
@city_szew I protest against Poland's involvement in the conflict Russia - Ukraine! We will die like others with the other Kaczynski!
@michaldworczyk @MorawieckiM Apart from the "political gold" that the PMM wants to do, it is an extremely irresponsible decision to go so about yourself to the areas where there is war and additionally more escalating conflict to NATO cinema Russia:/
I fear the so-called escalation of conflict. The killer must be stopped and not watched as he murders and be glad that he doesn't touch us. This dick escalates the conflict.
@Mikoaj93471185 @KatarzynaZalepa @KacapMSK Where did I write that? Human, how you don't understand... I keep saying it's not a conflict of good with evil as it's presented by the media, with the rest of which also represent certain interests, so that you don't look 0 1-year-old and you tell me to speak ukr= banda
@_mneczny @ZandbergRAZEM @pisorgpl @MorawieckiM Praise you risking your country's armed conflict for PR?! Let's imagine that something will happen to them. What will Poland do? What will the EU do. Are you ready to go to war and lose your life for a nice photo? Because Kiev is in the war zone.
@MorawieckiM @P_Fiala @JJJansaSDS @ZelenskyUa @Denys_Shmyhal You do not exaggerate with this help? Such guarantees were already given to Ukraine when it gave up nuclear weapons! Why are the guarantors silent? You are dragging Poland into armed conflict and Żeleński's daring!!! I am sure that most of the Polish society does not support such escalation!!!!
@MorawieckiM @P_Fiala @JJJansaSDS @ZelenskyUa @Denys_Shmyhal Symbolic gesture meaningless for real politics. It serves to drag to PiS susceptible to electoral manipulation and distract attention from the catastrophic negligence of this government in the field of security. This is why it is in our interest to end the conflict with the EU for the rule of law...
You can say that for so many thousands of years, things have changed, but historians confirm that this oldest conflict we know has erupted just as modern conflicts have... access to resources (4/10) https://t.co/asPlIeQwd9
@mswiergzynski1 @searcher Sikorski did likewise in 2014, which resulted in the awakening of the West Here is an attempt to imitate from a completely different political position - dismantling democracy in Poland and conflict with the EU continues. Biden's behavior after the election has not been forgotten Plus is the ridicule of Putin and his war
Don't let a stray rocket hit them (and there's an opportunity) and then a direct conflict is ready.
@Inventory51 and you're not surprised that even though the conflict is open, the coach thinks that the case is gone and calls both of them up every time making extra mess around the staff?
@Inventory51 I.e. such a situation has happened only once in the November window.In this last February club, the then Euro Leaguer, had the right not to play it "for principle" (the FIBA conflict), and in practice on the day of the game in Tallinn and the day after the match in Lublin were supposed to play games.
Perhaps the conflict will last for months, or maybe years, comment on Radio Doxa Dr. Tomasz Pawłuszko, an international security analyst and strategic studies from the University of Opole. @UniOpole https://t.co/UyrVSwxpRs
@NightZ This is not about polls. They put us all at risk. The whole of Poland can Europe. How will they bomb it will be the first conflict that started with the need to do good PR. Should Polish citizens go to war for a piece of Morawiecki and Kaczyński photos?
Europe has done a lot for Ukraine, we can't get directly involved in the conflict. If anybody thinks otherwise, it can always go as a volunteer https://t.co/ao2DeB5VFZ
@Oskar_M04 After all, he doesn't play at Karpin's, they have a conflict. With a month ago, the selectioner was at a meeting with possible Zenita soccer players and he wasn't there (@KatherineAFC wrote so)
@PetrygaTomasz The tragedy of Poles is this government, the rule of law should have returned long ago and you are fueling conflict with the Union during the war.
@Piotr88299498 @mareknaja @KrocpokBoy @Kulig1Kulig @wszewko I'm afraid that the Russians are gathering for some particular offensive, otherwise we have some chronic conflict to destroy some fucking rockets, other fuck rockets anyway
The opposition policy- They do not look at war as a real conflict, but as an event that causes problems PiS, so they want to block money from the EU without looking at what it will have for Poles.
@polska_times @ZelenskyUa @SawickiMarek @LLemaniak I protest against Poland's involvement in the conflict Russia - Ukraine! We will die like the other Kaczyński!

@PrzemekStaciwa Yesterday the Russian trawler cut the submarine light in Norway. In the Russian tv they talked about the occupation of Gotland and establishing a "no fly zone " to distract attention from the AU and draw NATO into conflict, JK decided to help and called to enter the AU with a peace mission. Genius.
I swear the only thing I'm gonna remember from the immunity department is macrophages and serological conflict pls so messed with those words.
@radio_357 Those who were afraid to enter the store even two months ago because they were afraid of colds, today the first want to mix Poland into conflict with Russia.
@RadioLublin I protest against Poland's involvement in the conflict Russia - Ukraine! We will die like the other Kaczynski!....why did they go to Ukraine? To determine the centralization of refugees? To occupy and surrender Bieszczady?
@RepublicaTV War is not only death and destruction.Hunger and disease go hand in hand with it.It needs a good plan to survive it, but at all costs the conflict must be extinguished and it cannot escalate !We must give resistance to this machine so that suffering does not affect generations.After all, the effects always last long.
@RoberSobocinski @gibon102 Another thing about the community is to butcher a neighbor because there is another nationality. Egoist people are also within their nation. Some of them, of course, are obsessed with 'strangers', but even they don't have to become murderers if the conflict gets worse.
If, God forbid, something would happen to our government delegation, we have a world conflict.

The Ukrainian side, which is understandable, is determined to involve NATO in the conflict. And here think what potential scenarios are possible. And Putin? Tupolewa fucked up, 2 times Grozny and dozens of personal enemies. Who knows what form it is today. https://t.co/VlMZFNGFLR
@Tomasz5ek @lis_tomasz On the Kremlin the term "deescalation by escalation" is known, i.e. first throw your opponent on his knees and then offer him "peace." Kaczyński applied the reverse method - the deescalation mission has a chance to bring the conflict to a higher level of... escalation.
