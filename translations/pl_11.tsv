2/... there has been a denial and defassification of Poland and https://t.co/XOiZHniKcd. bringing a new "government" from Moscow and withdrawing recognition of the Polish Government in exile, etc., etc.
6.2.3. The creation of military bases and the occupation of Ukraine by Russia. 6.2.4. The extermination of Ukrainians by the Russian occupation forces is referred to as the "denazification" (in fact genocide).
Here for example, Russian mail. Denazification. https://t.co/Owy68SELsY
@agnieszka_huf @Gosc_Niedzielny Absolutely not. Ukraine has been treated like a layto for many years. They gave money and didn't require anything. After the war, the fight against corruption in human trafficking needs to be severely denazed. Otherwise, there will be a Nazi state.
The Germans supported Hitler until the end of the WWII. And only the total defeat of Nazi Germany, the hard occupation, denazification and deimperialization led to a strong process of civilization of the German people. And it lasted 3/4 generations. With Russia today, the same must be done with Russia.
@ArturKey Germany will succeed in deputising as they succeeded in denazing.
@BeataGWinter Tempting. Enough to dename
@BeckettGangrel @Ankapitalizm You have here your freelancers and patriots remind you of people from the Wagner group who are now engaged in the "denazification" of Ukraine! How many went to hit the hangover to defend Poland? Ziobro! They shit in armor! https://t.co/fll0hcHJ7V
@bweglarczyk Shock. You have to drop the guest to Ukraine, let him see what Russian "demilitarization and denazification" looks like. And a multimillion-dollar group of refugees from Ukraine are tourists visiting Europe?. A useful idiot...
@C_Kazmirczak Necessary denazation. A free referendum will show that 98 % is behind the new People's Republic. Russian mir.

@DariuszMatecki @ALegucka What about the UPA crime settlement, the exhumation of victims of genocide on the AU? Is it okay for you to block exhumation and glorify bandits? Denazification should take place on the AU, but not under the auspices of the Russians only the West. Russian decommunization.
Denazification, defassisation, "people democracy," depolonisation. https://t.co/SPhEaeQ3sl
Denazification and liberation in practice ... in Russian version. https://t.co/JC8G2z1BFs
"denazification" using jihadists. I wonder if the big-minded mind somehow explains whether it leans over such threads;&gt;
@don_imba They're Nazis? And it's about connecting Russian sheep to dots with UA denasification?
@EmiliaKaminska Denazification on full.
@FilippFilipovic @ValentinaShim "denazification" (https://t.co/YVLT7r9WFr)
@g_woofer @Pinia84924868 @MarioRebeliant And did you ask what they were trying to achieve? What is the thesis? The occupation of Ukraine? And the Russians themselves said. Demilitarisation and denazification. Do you think that if they leave now without gaining Kiev it will be a defeat of the Russians? Or have they already achieved what they wanted?
In addition, Russian leadership still considers Russians and Ukrainians to be one nation and makes appropriate statements. According to them, it is about cutting off small-town nationalists from Ukrainian society (the same denazification) to
@JkmMikke Finally, denazification is about getting rid of the Nazis.
@catarinaa It's just Putinization in you or is it more necessary to dename?
When is the Russian denazification ??? https://t.co/d1f3G2riOC
@KClaire @Laweta2 Of course, the world has condemned it. It's a blasphemy and shame for Americans and a lot has been said about it and it's still coming back to it. It's another support to justify Russian aggression. Like the "denazification" of a weapon in Iraq, propaganda.
#Kwi_pro_wi Sadly, but this Putin's denazification of Ukraine is unfortunately not an abstraction. Who doesn't believe let's run - Bacy doesn't - shit lies. Putin can only stop giants, but who will stop the Banderites?https://t.co/QkuPyrcYYw
@LukaszBok @bronmatuidi Bo is coming to an end. What was Putin's goals? Denazification and demilitarization? Will they cut off supplies from the west? In a moment's time. Have they taken over the labs? Done. Have they seized nuclear power stations? Done. Will they take military units? Done. And the authorities... as in territorial defense...diverscs.
@matswiecicki Denazification of the palace.
@MBalawelder That's why it's so hard for the Russians to denazify. Such Germans have been in Nazis for several years, Jews - several centuries, counting only from the final edition of the Jewish Mein Kampf.
It was supposed to be a denazification, and the derusification of https://t.co/D9DJCSszL3 came out.
@MirekfraBergen @katarinaa It's also interesting that trolls are so fiercely armed with Orban's weapon. They're so strong at defending the Russian cone. Now they want to remove him from the power of fascists. What if they remove it? Denazification of Hungary? The head of the troll has it practiced.
@Mofet20 @Holinea69 @BettyElaWhite @1_Avenger @BacaPogorzelska Hungarian - Trauma Trianon. Germany in 1930 - Treaty of Versailles. We - Kresy. Russia - UA directly stimulating the myth of the Great War with Hitler... etc.
@MojoFilterr Nom. But for war there is always a purpose, war is not called "because I like it so much." Denazification is an obvious bluff and no one except Putin's psychophan believes it, it could be a real purpose if the Americans there have some really deadly weapon.
@nowakkmichal Meaning denazification:)
@nowakkmichal Oj, however, the Russians are beginning to have some reason with this denazification
@Piotr_Malecki I would assume that yes but I have already failed on such proposals once when bodrzerze ≈Åawrow talked about the fact that denazification be demilitarization of Ukraine already brings results and plans are being carried out. I hope that this time it will work out and will be a retort of victory and withdrawal
@PiotrWiel And now we will return to Putin's main postulate: "Denazification of Ukraine" by introducing a "prohibition of the functioning of nationalist and Nazi parties and repealing all resolutions glorifying the Nazis" - it may now be easier to understand what he meant.
@PlichtaMarek small denazification?
Before and after, i.e. "denazification" according to Putin. #PutinsWarCrimes https://t.co/chH2d291OT

Putin's denazification, which is the new work of Lion Tolstoy "Special Operation and Peace."

Roman FanPolish, a Jutuber from Transnistria, who lives in Poland, shows Russian propaganda on television, according to which Zelenski is in Poland, at the US embassy. Liberation and denazification. I call my Moldovan colleague. https://t.co/oPz1JFzVEa by @YouTube

@WarNewsPL1 uu, and this is getting serious. If a rocket had hit it, it would have just started a denazation. Although knowing Israel, they may be looking for a reason to seize the oligarch property.
Take something obvious - "decommunization"/"denazification" of Ukraine. The Kremlin breaks both narratives in order not only to be able to match its message to any recipient, but also to conflict these audiences among themselves - because now each page looks like a "good idiot."
But I assure you that the denazification and demilitarization of the great Russian empire continues!
It was supposed to be #denazification and the deputization came out.
@wszzewko Denazification of Ukraine does not go as fast as planned...:)
