@A6APMOT @aksana1947 Are you talking about the '80s, just socialist for bourgeois? No friend will come out, no social economy, just because there's no market relationship. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
@artemfrontend 'cause you're working, you're working, and then the fucker, the empire's back, the currency's back up, dead bodies again, economics in the throes, pensions are frozen, and you're in line for a chicken head ticket.
@AgustusEnemy, given that it's the main source of zombiation and it's been talked about by all of Russia's washed-up nasty zombies, it's a powerful blow to zombiation. It's an illusion out of this victory and it's going to break down. And on this farce, all the support of the state is worth it.
@azat166 @azamataka There is no private property or capitalism (the West suffers losses due to its actions), there is no objective media... It's all dead, but it's still living a lifeless life. Zombie economics, zombie media, zombie justice.
@bbcroussian Gonit. 500 billion is not worth the whole economy.
@Dmitry88872798 Well, look around, there's actually a result, an economy in the ass, and there's everything else, but there's no problem with fresh meat.
@dohod_ru "China's most populated country and the world's second-largest economy, friendly relations in Moscow severely limit the potential of sanctions..." and "Ukraine's scenario" could push China to intensify plans to reunite with Taiwan..." writes F.A. Andy Hekt.

@ErnestMakarenko Now decides Russia's fate, its place in the world, in the light of its defeat in Ukraine's adventure and surrender, and the delay in death like this, the economy is destroyed, irreversible trials begin in a month or two, the highest leadership is the war criminals on whom the tribunal has begun.
@GazetaRu Rather, the Western economies are now in a more sad state, if ours were, so we really have to think about who's having a broken economy.
@GolosAmeriki they want to think so, but Russia's economy is not so precarious that they can crush it, so it's not bad to want, and even with such "scareful" sanctions, the people of Russia continue to live and rejoice.

@Kerry_Shark is more likely to be the result of sanctions, and the economy of Russia is falling dumb in front of it.
@ketty_ef @pkugrdwa1 @bbcrussian @OdessaUkrop World doesn't need to show anything, he's already aware. How are Western sanctions, useful? Russia's economy is already on the rise?
@kommersant, but it's not clear who's winning this crisis, because everyone is suffering in their own way, and everyone's economy is suffering in their own way.
@kpre State thinks and does everything to minimize any consequences, I think our economy is ready for anything and can go through
@l1nway So let it be over, and I'm not gonna take the government and the state, because the last president of ours has done a lot compared to the past. The economy was better than that at Yushchenko.
@LaShevchenko @Varvargg @turkmendagz and yes, I don't blame anyone.
@Lexbez @vesi_news in general, in the world, the world's insane growth of world trade in the wwt countries, because the pf economy is thought to lie down because of the sanctions. A very interesting experiment would be how it would lie if there was a smart government in the pf.
@lifenews_ru what is always funny about her chicken brains) and it's not ashamed of such an idiot in the government to hold a shwa?) Russia's economy will grow even more.)
@max_katz Hahaha, I knew for a long time that the economy had never been a strong part of the Russians.
@Nickola_Sereda @ru_rbc. What do you think? understandable people know how to handle money and whose economy will be better! GDP will never destroy the economy.
@NickTum3 @Keisinger @ostndr @lexx_it @din_alt1 Reparations are still being paid, e.g. all arms shipments to Israel are paid by the Bundes. In the case of Germany, this is not how it feels to be private, the economy is big. For the Russian Federation, reparations can become pain.
@oksana_ov_oksan @tema57 @novaya_gaseta What we see is a roll-in. Censorship, brainwashing of the state propaganda, repression of dissent.
@pasha_hsb has a weapon? If you don't, you don't have any. At least you need a smooth shot. And when it starts, you're gonna try to get a kalash as fast as you can. By summer, the Russian economy is gonna collapse, dragging the RB to hell, worse than the '90s about three.
@Paula08491061 @neervmassage Again you shit yourself, Russian fascists in Kiev and civilians are bombing Russian fascists, and why Russia's economy is destroyed and destroyed? Why does no one in the west feel the sanctions and Russia is fucking coming?
@pevchikh Yes, I was the best opinion about him. Fuck the brands-- people are out of work, the economy is fucking in the ass. What the fuck are the possibilities?

@realy_strong @Vladimi_kvi @kommersant First, you can only buy a stock of diapers for a short time. Second, the economy is not Putin's credit, but the oil and reforms of the first governments. Third, instead of using money to help businesses, hospitals, and so on, they fight!
