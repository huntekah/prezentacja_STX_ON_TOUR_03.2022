@A6APMOT @aksana1947 Are you talking about the '80s, just socialist for bourgeois? No friend will come out, no social economy, just because there's no market relationship. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
@artemfrontend 'cause you're working, you're working, and then the fucker, the empire's back, the currency's back up, dead bodies again, economics in the throes, pensions are frozen, and you're in line for a chicken head ticket.
@AgustusEnemy, given that it's the main source of zombiation and it's been talked about by all of Russia's washed-up nasty zombies, it's a powerful blow to zombiation. It's an illusion out of this victory and it's going to break down. And on this farce, all the support of the state is worth it.
@azat166 @azamataka There is no private property or capitalism (the West suffers losses due to its actions), there is no objective media... It's all dead, but it's still living a lifeless life. Zombie economics, zombie media, zombie justice.
@bbcroussian Gonit. 500 billion is not worth the whole economy.
@Dmitry88872798 Well, look around, there's actually a result, an economy in the ass, and there's everything else, but there's no problem with fresh meat.
@dohod_ru "China's most populated country and the world's second-largest economy, friendly relations in Moscow severely limit the potential of sanctions..." and "Ukraine's scenario" could push China to intensify plans to reunite with Taiwan..." writes F.A. Andy Hekt.

@ErnestMakarenko Now decides Russia's fate, its place in the world, in the light of its defeat in Ukraine's adventure and surrender, and the delay in death like this, the economy is destroyed, irreversible trials begin in a month or two, the highest leadership is the war criminals on whom the tribunal has begun.
@GazetaRu Rather, the Western economies are now in a more sad state, if ours were, so we really have to think about who's having a broken economy.
@GolosAmeriki they want to think so, but Russia's economy is not so precarious that they can crush it, so it's not bad to want, and even with such "scareful" sanctions, the people of Russia continue to live and rejoice.

@Kerry_Shark is more likely to be the result of sanctions, and the economy of Russia is falling dumb in front of it.

@Paula08491061 @neervmassage Again you shit yourself, Russian fascists in Kiev and civilians are bombing Russian fascists, and why Russia's economy is destroyed and destroyed? Why does no one in the west feel the sanctions and Russia is fucking coming?
@pevchikh Yes, I was the best opinion about him. Fuck the brands-- people are out of work, the economy is fucking in the ass. What the fuck are the possibilities?
