7/ "...and a world less economically connected is one in which disruptions and conflict are more thinkable.  Are these costs unavoidable? Probably. But they can be mitigated. One alternative to importing foreign-made goods, for example, is to import foreign-born workers."

@annabotting Media stations should use their platforms to bring about peace? The reality is the longer this conflict can be expanded, the greater profit to be had! Let's not forget the years of EU/NATO/USA interference that forced Russia to take this action? @natomission_ru @RussianEmbassy https://t.co/pbSRLGQNVz
@antoniogm This drunk tweet doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Russia is an incompetent army but we have to worry about them invading Germany? Russian nuclear threat was ‚Äúsuccessfully navigated‚Äù‚Ä¶by NOT engaging in direct conflict with them and avoiding a hot war. dude why would you even cite that?
Apart from it,the import cost has gone up due to rising freight cost. Trade are being done with Canada,Australia as Black Sea Region remains disturbed due to Russian and Ukraine conflict. Even Egypt has extended export ban for another 3 months to June -2022..

@CantGetR1ght @Hiko26832791 @friendlyanders @g2norbilleusz @IWDominateLoL Russia has the ability to form a coalition with China, the only reason Europe is enforcing the embargoes is because they are lapdogs for NATO.

There are now talks about rationing diesel/petrol. If the Russia/Ukraine conflict continues you will only be allowed to get 50 litres diesel/petrol only from next month
There is a tremendous amount of evidence that clearly shows the US has been instrumental in creating and triggering the Russia - Ukraine conflict!  The 'crime' about to be committed is that the 'world' ignores this the same way that they have ignored US interference in the past!
There is no need to have an opinion on this, if you didn't really have one before.  The Issues between RUSSIA and Ukraine are 'all or nothing' level of interest.  I intend to report a summary explanation of this conflict upon its resolution.  Feel free to join the discussion.
Things I dislike: -drama -making people uncomfortable (in any way) -messing up -being abused  Really just bad things. I am an empath and honestly very ignorant. If I hurt somebody, it is never intentionally. I hate conflict. If I mess up, tell me immediately. Do not assume.
