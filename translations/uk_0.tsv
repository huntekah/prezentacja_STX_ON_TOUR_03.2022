@BestWear @leustenko1 We're going to talk to you after the war!
@Dildzer@nikkey27494 @Anri_Tina Country was united not because of it, but rather instead of preparing for war, it was built by means of an allied intelligence, and when it was proven to be a war, it was a celebration that formed and shouted that the west was being bent.
@European Pravda @ukrpravda_news In the meantime, in western Ukraine, which also had to be driven away by refugees, the landlords increase their rents. That is, they don't just put in the clouds, but they increase the prices they set at the beginning of the war when the first wave of refugees arrived.
@jull_levine echo of war. Chechenian by the way
@Kattzee My all experience, some with military and military education, has caused all those who weren't in the U.S.U. at the beginning of the war.

@sosidko64 @AndreVasilovuh you it's better visible what to do and how to say it.
@yorguuena. It's the real heroes of war.
What about these negotiations, during times of battle? The terms at this stage of the war can only be about the exchange of prisoners, especially those that are captured.
And after the war, I'm still buying at least https://t.co/22QhW9na4K.

These are the parties that want to show that they're all hands on diplomacy, but the main requirements that are really the cause of the war are nobody's refusing https:/t.co/UzoxUfBq.
For the first time in the war, I prepared myself to eat cheese, according to our designer recipe, which my daughters and my husband love so much, but I only had to eat alone, and the rest is frozen, and I'll eat when our family comes back together.

All you need to know about my grandmother, running from war abroad, she's lost half her valuable jewelry, but she's bringing with her French self-helper in 1827.
Wonder why we still have American, British, Polish TV channels and radio stations on the 20th day of the war?
The second army of the world, on the twentieth day of war, cannot capture the state where they are shooting themselves, but in fact, it's a face and a decree.

According to UNHCR High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the country has already left over three million people, the largest being 1.8 million in Poland.
At the time of the war, the state of the richest Ukrainians had dropped dramatically, and Ahmets lost $10 billion, and Poschenko didn't have the billionaire https://t.co/YynSPhZ9VK
There is a war day: https://t.co/QMUVffxCPB
They said the world was cleaned up after college, but it's probably not completely, or how do you explain that the morgenster music video is the first thing in the YouTube trend during the war, and it's going to be the second wave of cleaners, maybe it's going to produce some results.
My favorite type of Russian is the ones who got tired of the war until they lived their normal lives and didn't see that war.
Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I believe we're going to win, and I'm going to list the places I want to visit after the war is over!
My 21-day puppet is a full-scale war: life is interesting and motivation is strong philosophy, psychology is the most important thing to be human and say you're alive I'm a living person!

Today a new Ukrainian nation is born in the midst of war! The night of struggle, pain, despair, and doubt is dark, and therefore we can only defeat it together! Together, united in our efforts to combat the enemy, all of us, approach the dawn of a new Ukrainian world! https://t.co/bP3BFn3dir
Now any moment from time to time it seems so distant and impossible...
I don't have a lot of internet, so I don't watch video, and it says that Jan topless in a new video touched the war theme in Ukraine, is that right?
I went to the store to buy the needed candy and the strategic store for two days at curfew, and in my JC, there's no war, kids are playing, people are laughing in line, and for a while I felt like everything was okay, euphoria was not for long.
It's a huge stress for an organism that's wrangling at two in war, having a child now -- very difficult and dangerous, and it's still NOT good enough to have a positive figure of numbers. If you're willing to give women this in favor of your humanity's idea, you're worse than it is.
that what's already happened in these 20 days of war made you angry/expressed by the greatest rage
What worries me is, after the war, how do I communicate with people who didn't survive the war? Because they seem to be some sort of alien right now?
I don't pull that out, and specifically, that in front of the war, stress is something that everyone thinks I'm okay and they can take it easy on me.
