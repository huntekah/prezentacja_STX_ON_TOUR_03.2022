@360tv Et specifically to kill them?
@agipizza Yeah, that fucking we're gonna remember how Lice's gonna get started
@ak9shadow is just about that. I just can't find a series. There's a lot to explain, though in a rather slutty form with the elements of conspiracy.
@alb204alb @helpad Well, that's not what happened a long time ago, motherfucker.
@amane_v it fucking hurts... you don't have any cardboard on your address? Why?
@anatoliisharii naturally, and that's logical, as long as we're talking about gumcoridors, and what you want to say is that the Nazi regime wouldn't be angry, even Washington wouldn't make such a statement either in Libya or in Iraq or in Syria.
@anidacid is in the cart, but it's a musk, I take it you're Peter.
@BassistAxel @JulianPaulovich @wlcm_to_hel @shivalova1940 @fillpackart @artemfrontend, and this will be a market aspect -- some businesses will pay it and others won't, so let's see what's the point, capitalism with a human face, socially responsible, somewhere the bureaucrat cries out of those words.
@Bibigul_z @spervogoraza So guests can't be joked because they're guests? Even what the masters are joking about? Well, in my opinion, this is a strange story.

@ElenaSu01204809 Ah, so the cure is understandable. Well, even if there wasn't an ad, you can't do it without a doctor, and so Manya's neighbor told her to help her, and she'll buy it too.

@_gradinko @jakeshieldsajj @ssstto This is possible in your country? Is that a crowd? How does the flag of Russia's country and the flag of the nationalist regiment Azov come together? Most likely it's a stupid provocative fairy. Otherwise, there would be a flag of the Russian Nazis.

@kanzlerin_grchk I can't, first they're choking people with sanctions to break the path to a hungry stomach, and when someone's trying to resist a regime with the greatest risk to their freedom and life they're like-- oh, well, they don't like the sanctions)
@KBalagov has developed the face of a femme born with a subconscious desire to fuck off, but these dirty jokes are, and so on. Because the system as such is designed to bend and talk precisely about the physiological trend, not about deviations or conscious behaviors.

It's funny to see in my infopole some violent anti-masks speakers in their time, with arguments like, "These morgues, you're being taught to shut your mouth and you're sneaking around," now changed to, "No, I don't, I don't, we don't know the truth, they're there.
