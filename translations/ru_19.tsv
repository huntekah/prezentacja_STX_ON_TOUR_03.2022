@AlexisVasde was sanctioned
@antiputler_news Burgers also understood Macron's sly plan and decided to stay. Congratulations to the wankers for the sanctions, reschedule a couple of times on my behalf.
@bbcrussian was afraid to get sanctioned.
@brewerov State is a terrorist, you're an economic sanction, then we'll take 140 million hostages from human rights, and by law we'll start killing if you don't stop.
@BrigitaGrohman @Scaurus9 @remidios @VladKo58448539 In Belarus there are all imported drugs, despite sanctions in Russia, insulin and a lot of other imported drugs have gone missing, stopped buying people's supplies for a week, then lie down and die Out of sanctions, lift sanctions, everything will act differently from the terrorist
@bulgari1971 Don't you think these sanctions were made up long before the operation started and in case the forks fucked up south Russia?
@Dmitry788 Another Pozreot, as if he didn't understand what sanctions had been imposed on the town hall, and now they're measuring who caused the most damage to whom. First, the perpetrator sits in the Kremlin and forgives him and Russia.
@dw_russianA we put on your sanctions, and in fact, we're giving up American brand clothes on our own. https://t.co/CJLjD1hTB

Ukraine must understand that the US is responsible for what everyone is suffering now and sanctions should be for the US. This US incentive may be economic, something they sometimes need to stay at the top of the pyramid.
@faridaily_Wait in the EU said who thinks differently than we do. Nothing bothers? Democracy she's such a democracy )
@GazetaRu has lived the fucking superpower.
@GazetaRu Sanctions is a response to Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine, a free and sovereign State, and a Russian citizen will protest despite repression. https://t.co/9nhMvWJL6A
@G_Zyuganov Gena, Japan is imposing sanctions on your property there, explain it, and the second, before you hang out, go to high school.
@jozefkneht1 @Saturn71197768 The main result is that the sanctions were made for that, and if that's what's starting to appear, then the sanctions are working, and it's not bad.
@LifeAsArnab @BBCWorld Sanctions are over. Only hamsters are left.
@MD_RF @DailyMailUK @RusembUkraine @genconfodessa @RusConsKharkov @ConsRusLvov @RussianEmbassayR @RussianEmbassey @MID_DNR @Mod_russia U.S. says that the Titanic was sunk by an iceberg.

@MD_RF U.S. says that Titanic was drowned by an iceberg. Ukraine must understand that the US is responsible for the fact that everyone is suffering now and that sanctions should be for the US. This US stimulus may be economic, something they sometimes need to stay on top of the pyramid.
@moxsolomon @huliVVamZZ West wanted to introduce and get gas, interesting now how to sing, well, nothing, they have green energy.
@Oleg_Ilchenko @Kotsprimusom1 And then, "Russian, save our diplomats, and then we will sanction you."
@pan_dok Sanctions won't be lifted while he's in power.
@Pers0naGrata and I think it's wrong to think of sanctions as a punishment for Russians, but the goal, I think, is to weaken the economy so much that Russia has no resources to go on with the war, and the Russians are "accompanied losses" that are ignored only because of too high stakes.
@Pj8laZZVBBD5Xhl @kkkmich71 Grandpa in the bunker likes, and sanctions are good for us!
@roizmangbn I can only say that the fsb worked perfectly and we in Ukraine almost believed that the editor of the main channel on the rush had eight years of work and news about the boys in their underwear, and the conscience of Agha woke up.

@sasKenigsberg sanctions for generations!
@serge_morrison @vadimpa @jemappellala states and the EU are helping us enough in this war. After the war, we'll be both in the EU and NATO. Yes, if they had introduced the same sanctions in 2014, it wouldn't have happened. But the guilty one here is Rasha and all 140 million of its inhabitants. Mordor will be destroyed.
@tass_ageny So we've planned all the sanctions and that there's no sugar? Sometimes you have to admit your mistakes.

You don't understand diabetes and what's threatening sanctions from the government to diabetics.
@VLazarevik @DankHooper @Mendeleex sanctions sygurno hima and hysterate tenkivite per day.
@WALDO_WASSERMAN He's often wildly tweeting. It's very difficult to calculate right now, the main input from pigs is war and sanctions. The war is unclear when and how it ends, the sanctions don't seem to understand what the linkages are. We don't know how much ass with crops.
@YourAnonNews @Pirelli I'll tell you a secret: Maquis is still working, eple pey is also working, and so is the master of cards and visas, and the cola is produced. Capitalism is not capable of sanctions. Too much loss

You can always look at three things-- fire, water, and how Europeans impose sanctions on Russia.
Mordor forbade a vacation in Gelendik Biden and his son, and they freeze and nationalize their deposits in rubles in Sberbank, and the fucking Americans are likely to lift their sanctions against Putin and his entourage.
In the world market, oil, gas, metals and grains are precious, and anti-Russian sanctions are damaging to the entire world economy, and even Switzerland is talking about a possible recession, and Ilon Mask complained about the inflation that his companies, SpaceX and Tesla, faced.

You know, the bottom of Pulae, before you sit down like this, you're gonna ruin everything. Why? Who are you protecting? And if you think you're gonna get forgiven and you're gonna get the sanctions lifted, that's a mistake. The more you're gonna ruin, the more you're gonna have to pay for it.
