.@ADeshchytsia in #GuestRadioZET: NATO and EU position must be immediately! Clear, hard and firm. We must stop Russia, otherwise the Third World will explode in a year or two @RadioZET_NEWS
@Aettka No and will also represent the EU's position.
@AllaboutRoL_ @TK_GOV_PL Who signed under this text, specifically name, position? Or did it write itself? Everyone in Europe and the Republic of Poland see how the law is being violated by the PiS and you do not understand how the judicial system works in the Republic of Poland, for fuck's sake what wonders, Pavłowicz, Piotrowicz, Przyłębska
@arfish @SlawomirMentzen Just look at the EU's actions and Germany's position towards Russia. Seriously, this is a counterweight to the Soviets?
@boobiko @KrzyLuft @WiadomosciTVP @tvp_info A where does Orban support Putin's aggression? Orban did not support the energy sanctions that would be imposed on Russia. Exactly the same position was taken by the EU.
@danutahuebner quickly changed their position, but not the modus operandi. They wave the EU flag and pull us out of the EU at the same time.
@DariuszRosati @NewsPlatform When it comes to EU membership Hungarians have a similar position to Poland and that's what it's all about ...
@dd61742102 @Bart_Wielinski Mercy, after all Orban has been repeatedly criticized by politicians for his current position. Apart from what else is taking care of his own national interest and other anti-EU interests. The construction of ns2 shows how Germans, contrary to many other EU countries, have done their job with Putin.
The Estonian Parliament demands a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Yesterday, 14 March, it adopted a resolution on Russia's aggression against Ukraine directed at the parliaments of other EU countries and NATO, in which it calls for a ban on flights over Ukraine (Estonian World).
It is fascinating how the Polish authorities quickly managed to change their position on the EU. There was a bad and imaginary Community, now the EU is our right state. It is a pity that this has only been realized in the face of bombs falling on Ukrainian houses.
@GiertychRoman was not lying, this is the official EU position. Read before we compromise ourselves for the nth time...
To remind those who have lost their memory recently, the EU position is also the position of Polish MEPs from the PO and left https://t.co/draPycJacQ
@IzaBadura @KarmaloopRebate @lis_tomasz Update posts from March this year. Human Opinions are changing. The EU has already taken a stand. And you are in 2021
@jacek_Libera The drag-off effect between the EU and the US on Iran, due to games in Israel for a position concerning the AU (capitulation - EU/RFN vision or strong support - US), Bennett and Lapid.
@Jerzy31524440 I understand frustration but this will not change the fact that nothing happens in the EU without the approval of Germany. You can only patiently fly around Europe and ask, translate and strive in the hope that Germany will change its position and allow sanctions to be introduced to a wider extent.
There is a position of EU leaders in Ukraine. Lithuanian President of "historic night in Versailles" https://t.co/l8EVBIF2dj
@wojc @LukaszP85 Very not a nice answer. The EU should have a clear and firm stand against starving EU citizens.
@KurkowskiDg @P_Fiala @MorawieckiM @JJansaSDS @ZelenskyUa @Denys_Shmyhal I ask for the EU's official position on this visit, because so far I only hear the opinions of TT experts - unless you speak as employees of this institution.
@KurkowskiDg @P_Fiala @MorawieckiM @JJansaSDS @ZelenskyUa @Denys_Shmyhal After all, you assure that the position of the EU and the UN is different, so you base your opinion on something.
@LenaBobinska But have you read that these are the private opinions of EU representatives? Not the official position? And it is not specified who thinks so, so it might as well be sucked out of your finger?
@__Lewica @RobertBedron @tvn24 Let her drop these pink glasses and see what the "EU leaders" are doing, i.e. Germany and France. Thanks to their policies, women and children are dying. If the EU were a federal state today, its position would be exactly what Germany represents today.
@lis_tomasz Of course it is. It only writes a slimy, otherwise it interprets the EU's position
@MalgoskaEmka @domi_long @JacekCzarnecki1 @KonradPiasecki They won't buy. And this is Kaczyński's defeat, if he were in the European mainstream, he could develop a common EU position in Kiev to say, "We Europe will give so much and that's that, we will do it and Siamto." It would be something big, and so it's a symbolic trip. What can Kaczyński promise?
@michalkarnowski Here you have the achievements of the government of the PIS, now you are saying that the EU forbids you to close the movement of trucks on our border.Somehow you had no problems closing this border for refugees without looking at the position of the EU. Maybe the state of emergency needs to be done to not write the truth again? https://t.co/2AKSatn7Cj
@MiloszGac @PAPinfo Do we know the position of the Polish government on the supply of gas, oil and coal from Russia to Poland and, by the way, other EU countries?
@m_caluzny @MarcinPalade You little, lying and stinking member. Where is the EU position on this matter?
@MSzuldrzynski Morawiecki is not a private person, he is a prime minister. I have not heard from the EC confirmation that Morawiecki is going there in the knowledge of the whole EU, represents her position previously agreed. It is important because promises, demands, decisions of the whole EU have a powerful power.
@MWardzyniakowa Let's say that they were sent by their boss KE and this is her clever procedure. The EU position represents Ukraine's opponents...

They are not able to release such a discredited man, and are even opposed to such a position, and are proud, and mouths full of calls to the government of the Republic of Poland for an embargo on Russian coal, which is the sole competence of the EU, and what is blocked by Germany with which they sit in a single faction. https://t.co/4AGmC77Hah
@NightZ @marek5692 UNSCR and UN General Assembly have already discussed the issue of aggression against Ukraine. They have not taken any resolution but a position that calls for peace. The EU has no such competence, nor NATO. Russia has been removed from the Council of Europe.
@OlekMishalski @BeataSzydlo @MarzenaPaczuska Pajacu, if the EU supported Poland's position at that time and dragged Lukaszenka to the West, there would be no war today.
@PabloMo09825801 @Conversation_RMF With sanctions you have to have a common position with the EU, he is right.
@PawelWronskigw Did you really trust Dworczyk? And as for criticism, did you forget about Smolensk? It is also worth listening to the statements of the EU and NATO.
@pisorgpl @michaldworczyk @PolsatNewsPL Misza, why are you lying? The consultation would aim to develop a common position and offer for Ukraine. Question: What position, proposals, promises will Jarosław Kaczyński make on behalf of the EU?
@pogodzy Mr. Minister, the Prime Minister of Poland was the person who claimed that in Smilensk they were digging 1.5m deep and then sipping coffee with hangovers! This person is still a high position in the EU. What we are talking about.
During his speech in the Bundestag, Olaf Scholz announced that, after agreeing with the EU countries, sanctions would include important banks in Russia. In his speech, he did not mention that sanctions would cover all banks, as suggested by @ZiobroPL.
The Polish position is clear: it must end, but sealed tire arrives from EU countries and without a decision of the Union we cannot do it. Prime Minister Morawiecki is lobbying for this," said @radekfogiel about the ban on crossing Russian tirists through Poland. https://t.co/ZiOxXjbjdc
@porzechowski @kosik_md The most important thing is the 700 million from the EU managed mainly by DE and FR, which have been sponsoring Putin for years. For the current situation in Ukraine, the biggest responsibility lies with 1. Russia, 2. Germany 3. France and better understand and revise its position against the above.
@PremierRP @MorawieckiM Zero purchased weapons take no pie...and we are waiting for a position in the EU you want to catch up, sell yourself
@PrzemWenerski @donaldtusk In the EU employ as many experts! For example, Biedron got a position in some committee dealing with domestic violence. Well, in this he had personal experience! The same expert is Tusk, Putin's man in Warsaw.
The Belgian Government adopted a neutral position on the conflict and did not impose sanctions on which the EU was pressing (Serbia is applying for EU membership). The national air carrier Air Serbia maintained connections with Russia which cannot be operated by airlines from EU countries.

@Sekielski I hope that their position and message with which they have agreed with the EU and NATO. We are Oneness. They said so. Fear to be afraid of what they will come up with.
@SitdamDamian is a prominent member of the PO and deputy Tusk so his party of harm will not give him and can always promote him to what position so that he does not deal with Warsaw only he is needed to criticize the government and to make the EU move and give money directly to their local governments
Meeting of EU leaders in Versailles. There is a position on Ukraine: https://t.co/cNoMMZSKho https://t.co/q8xBN3ifc1
The position of the Pentagon, the NATO and Israel suggests that the Americans of Ukraine have written down their losses. I am not even writing about the position of the EU, because it is of little importance here. When the Russians leave the AU, this country will be withdrawn to the era before the collapse of the USSR. The bottom line is: the West does not recognize the AU as its part
The position of the progressive and light KO and the EU forces: Waiting . Waiting for Putin's forces to murder thousands more defenseless civilians on the occasion of bleeding out themselves , and when he is already lying bleeding out then to enter triumphantly with the forces of "peaceful" . #minela8
The UEFA position: "We will work with the EU and with the relevant Member States to be fully clear and act in line with any appropriate steps taken with developments."
@Szczery2015 You agreed earlier on this position with Le Pen, Orban, Salvini and Trump, is that so? When is this referendum about the EU, what was it you mentioned before?
@shefernaker And what EU position will they present there? They had the EU's approval for this escapad?

@Wad_emecum @kowalskijanpl @Matt_Kertz shyly I will only notice that Eastern policy and Europeanisation of issues such as NS2, the whole energy policy, etc. Poland has spent many years trying to develop a common EU position. And it was not Poland here, as you say, 'stupid'.

@Wieszczeczynski @SamselMarcin EU says it was the Polish website that informed them, not consulted and agreed on their position.
@ZiobroPL Mr. Zbigniew, can you tell us what your attitude towards the Union is? Then do we want to be a member of the EU or not? Let's forget about the fights with T and others.
So that #NATO does something and #EU doesn't, it's also an example that the EU is also taking a position. https://t.co/ozrLdwPJmF https://t.co/A2EaXFN9ot
