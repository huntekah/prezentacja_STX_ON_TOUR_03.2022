@JmsBnd20@AllaUkeine 2015 @tatena_mis which "revelation mayor"?)
@kkolorfull economy has to work so that we can throw money on our defenders.
@Lychakivsky @artmaister1 @radiosvoboda but you first have to realize that there is no money for everything, we can't spend it on the army but forgetting everything else, the economy won't raise itself, the same army won't get it from where it comes from. Enhancement of self-defense, but improves the lives of ordinary people too.
@maryjurtas Byy wins the army. The war wins the economy. Your investment is very important for sales and according to taxes
@navix maybe I'm hoping it'll finally give you some kind of effect, so we'll remember that Ukraine can be a fighter even for aircraft carriers, and by that point we'll have not two built in 30 years, modernized tanks, but a powerful, high-class, contract army, strong economy and a single society.
The reason why I'm doing this is because I'm going to look at the standard of living, because it's lower, given that the country is bigger, more opportunities, if I were to get the country right, it would be possible to build and build and tourism and cultural rest, and that's how the economy is completely broke.
You know how to destroy a tank, you know how to kill a tank, you also have enough volunteers, and the economy is falling, and you never have enough money to go down, so design, it's also super important.

They asked China for help. &gt;&gt; China sees there's no one else to marry, if there's not even a hacker, the economy moves, the soldiers don't want to fight.
@stupor_mozga "The Russian nation of the enemy means their consolidation around the authorities" sounds very, very counterintuitive... because of the actions of the country under the sanctions, and the Russians go through all the companies, the economy of the country is falling apart. Doesn't people think, "Our president deb, let's hit him?"
