The war is going on, we're going on, we're going on, we're going to Kiev three times in the morning, we're going to have a good one, we're going to have a full-time presentation, and we're going to have a career in FIFA, and we're gonna end the war, we're gonna win, we're gonna win, we're gonna have a fucking rat who's gonna answer for everything.
@4EU3 So either the maintenance of the empire and the foreign war or the collapse of the empire and the internal war. Note Putin was once also quite democratic, but the political order in Russia forces politics to become conditional Stalin and to wage a cold war with the US.
@55Irina100 @_Mudryj_ @From_Spb_ @the_ins_ru for American Indian genocide by Russian colonizers when will you repent? Russian-Tlinkit War, for example
@A62930479 What war? There is no war. There is no special operation. Through Ukraine, with payment, Russia's gas is still going to Europe.
@Andrew_from_BY @Ataman86Djon @SerhiiRomanenko There's no excuse for Belarusians at this time. The war will end, then we can talk somehow. Now we're on different sides of the missile launch trajectory.
@arestovych to whom the war and who thinks the money is.In Ukraine, during the war, on the 20th day of the war, Alpha Bank, Sberbank, Prominvest Bank, VTB Bank. I think someone fucking pissed off. Is there a chicken on a pole?
@AzarovNikolai_When war is clear
@BTMARkady @IsraelThreads Why aren't you telling the truth? Eight years of war in Donetsk at the initiative of the cremble! It's the Kremlin's job to bring troops to Ukraine where there was a war between the services! Ukraine's services were on their territory. Why don't you write what's going on in Ukraine and Donetsk?
@Ejch16 @SFAINE2 That's the point - you want to fight and we don't. You want to kill and we don't. You want to torture and we don't. That's what war, death, and misery was for you. You got what you wanted, that's just how it works. And we want the world and it's gonna be with us.
@elonmusk Ilon, launch into orbit over Moscow a small tactical nuclear charge. Let Putin slap it in his pants and the war will end immediately. Enough with the smallest bomb. You can even bluff.
@EuropeanPravda @ukrpravda_news What's the war for?
Of course, I had a scandal with my mom when she also said, "Why do I grieve more than any other one," but la, we have different situations, there's a fucking war, you're mourning your friend.
@inga253 @menywddig @BolsheNeVovan And war will end
@jkotia_minyongi has been asked. What's better? "Surely a major war with Russia and a transition to NATO based on the results of the victory over Russia." Here's Ukraine, in the desire of power, and now pays that price.
@jkotia_minyongi so this problem was from 2014, and to date no one talked about it in 2019-20-21, and the war was going on. That's exactly how he openly says that their actions are a provocation to a military operation. Why would they do that?
@kelevra_vsemid @spervogoraza Thank you, I won't even risk )) in Russia, for the word "war" could be infested for 15 years.
@kolezev are the key words behind "God, is there a war?" What do you think is going to happen to you?
@LorentsMadam Heroam - SLAWA!! The controversial question is... and Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine is also "The Holy Uninfrared"! ... War is war and gas is by order! ... I mean, march the Ukrainians, yourself about Russian fascists, but on your territory!

@panmaxim @Jouhmur First is him, this war is not needed by anyone, including his oligarchs.
@Paula08491061 @neervmassage Again you shit yourself, Russian fascists in Kiev and civilians are bombing Russian fascists, and why Russia's economy is destroyed and destroyed? Why does no one in the west feel the sanctions and Russia is fucking coming?
@planetary_hleb I'll say more! it took war for Western society to understand that Vladimir Vladimirovich was driving this ZO smugly through his lips. No wonder the ZO is now bursting with hate farts.
I mean, for you, a revolution, a civil war is a fucking war, right?
@rianru When this war is over, every Russian who you meet will claim that he has always been against this war and never supported Putin.
@rianru I believe that the word "defolt" will be banned as well as the "war" will be some kind of "special financial situation." As it is said, remember this post Dog A the food can be downloaded via VPN? https://t.co/KFEHz9Nb4

@SobolLubov Ask the Chechens: You yourself had a war, you liked how your cities were destroyed? Why would you want Ukraine to do that? Why did you come there? It wasn't your war, get out of there.
@soul_vtuber @sgorberd @irina4100613 The same thing as everyone facing war in Ukraine is death. The risk of rising food prices for the majority of the population is death. The risk of a lack of drugs for everyone is death. In fact, diabetes is just an example, the same can be said of asthmatics.
The most interesting thing is that they're probably going to get to Russia and they're going to get a job that the Russians aren't going to get when they're unemployed. The war is bad, but everything has its limits.

@v_tretyakov So with the pipe, around the war, gas continues to flow safely to the European market.
@WALDO_WASSERMAN He's often wildly tweeting. It's very difficult to calculate right now, the main input from pigs is war and sanctions. The war is unclear when and how it ends, the sanctions don't seem to understand what the linkages are. We don't know how much ass with crops.
And you know what I'm thinking right now? And if the civil war is about to start, the wata will destroy us, they're really bigger, they're evil and ruthless, they're growing up with them. Guards, fsb, Omons, Sisters and Wagners.

I still don't understand the idea of the Ukrainians that it's the Russian people who have to repent for this kind of war?

The Ukrainians don't seem to like the war with Russia anymore, and they did a month ago.
In my mind, I realize that the war is close to violence, but it's everyone's fucking personal choice, why in the world is a stupid show of power over the weak of this NORMA?

It's like a war in Yugoslavia 30 years later. Except the Serbs didn't have a JO.
I think they understand that the war has already been lost, and it's everywhere, and yet they're gonna throw even more cannony meat into her ass, more urgents, cadets, law enforcement officers (and mostly young men).
