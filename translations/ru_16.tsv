@Okho766ivU28oL8 The RZR has transferred these wagons to the balance of the ooo "Chechen Railways", so there will soon be a conflict of interest for the economic subjects.
@360tv the representative of this compost back in 2019 said that they would prolong the conflict until NATO got involved... in agony trying to catch hope now.
@4EU3 doesn't even put a gun on us to trigger a conflict, it can't even be said that it's fighting with our hands, and why the same propaganda is laughing at it.
@_aberration_ @aggrreading many then successfully built into the system and started signing repressive laws, which I see as a betrayal, not an attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully.
Anonymous announced on Twitter that Russian national broadcasting and video distribution services had hacked. "The most peaceful way to stop this conflict at this stage is Russian rebellion and Putin's expulsion," said AnonymousTV. Very gentlemanly.
@bbcroussian No Billion dollars is only a fraction of how much Biden spent on Ukraine, it's not a dozen, it's not surprising, it's doing everything now to heat the conflict even more.
@BeygulSlavik All right, since everyone was always good at everything, why was there a conflict on Donbas?
@BolsheNeVovan I have a daily conflict with the bum, not only at work, but at the gym shop at the cafe. I honestly didn't think there were so many, so many!
@bulleproof_ @btnko @Brazil1020 @alyanapopova is a symbolic expression for those who speak of a full war I sincerely regret the loss of human life, even those who owe me war sincerely regret that the conflict has come to such a degree but also to tolerate deception and heperballation I do not wish
@bunopus has the opposite view - the conflict is the struggle of capitalists and capitalists worldwide. National capitalists obviously lose, decide to use military force, but I don't know what they're exterminating from the war.
@caesarzepppeli saw your conflict and fucked because he wasn't carrying a cake, but fucking we were just pretty close friends, and I'm surprised what came to this:
@cgFMTQdiL8jevM @iridaraduga @McFaul accepting your point of view, 8 years of the Kremlin silently watched Donbas bomb the conflict with their chithamnets.
@DI_Ukraine @mykolayovych45 Gonna dig in and secure themselves. To hit harder and freeze the conflict
@ElenaM19365983 @shtfaceGlorious @pirozhenshina Khmer and war and special operation and peacekeeping mission, all referred to as armed conflict
@Erlinda58832985 @v_milov What happened there?
If Ukraine were in NATO, they would have provoked a conflict with Russia anyway. Then Russia would be much worse than it is now. Now I hope Ukraine will never be able to join NATO again. #Russian UkraineConflict #Russian #MarinaOsyunnikov
@feechkaaaaaa @snakyss is your opinion, which is not true for me, but I don't want to get into conflict, but yes, it does, because it looks very hypocritical and for people who can't leave or are in danger to see it can be traumatic.
@girlcrushpower They haven't been interested in this topic for eight years, and now genius political scientists. Eight years, the authorities have done everything they can to resolve the conflict peacefully and tell them that Ukraine has done everything for this development, they won't hear it. If it wasn't for this confession, all of this would have continued.

@gracepotato8 The idnr was spoken less in the world because it looked like an internal conflict to world public opinion, so it was presented by our propoganda, everything was running, and the number of victims fell very much, and now in Europe, Roskomnadzor is happening all over the 20th century canons.
@hilyaleftside @hyenopsto is a "local conflict," 5 million out of 200 there and so on, and a lot of it.
@KhmelnitskyP @XDemonR1 @stalker_thegame I don't think sponsoring the armed forces will stop anything. It turns out you're putting wood in the fire. In this case, when the lives of peaceful people are at stake, there's got to be someone who's gonna win, just as soon as it's over, and when it's sponsored, the conflict will only continue.
@kiyanovsky @vadimpa @jemappellala Think about it with your head, and don't involve extra people on your opponent's side.
@Kpopnator @stopkah When a conflict between two countries rather than internal strife within the state, the president and the country are the same, the rift in the country is now very beneficial to the west and Europe, and Ukraine is just an excuse to divide the great Russian people, you are, by the way, indistinguished by who and on whose behalf you write!
@kuleshov_al I think the real problem is that propaganda is underrated. Sometimes it's a direct lie, sometimes it's a manipulation. For example, Russian-speaking people in Moldova who complained about refugees have been paid. Is this the easiest way to start a conflict? No.
@kwmnooroo is my old conflict, how I started dating a girl and how I broke up with her, and how my friend has a better life than I do.
@littllebowski No, I repeated my question from the previous tweet, and you're trying to force me to prove what I meant. If you misunderstand me and already see it, why are you fuelling the conflict next? For what?
@max_katz Katz, what nonsense! The goal is the same as in all war conflicts in the post-Council space: destabilization, dismemberment of the country into pieces, permanent military conflict or its frozen state, puppet governments.
@MaYa_Ukraine @Oslobidska @Podoliak_M officially did not hear... but they once again say that they don't want a conflict with the Russian Federation... and including us in NATO creates a conflict... logically they wouldn't do it.
@newkc14 Attaboy Kadyrov: Not only can he do something with a word, but he's ready to go in the front row, along with his soldiers. I hope he gets a green light and tomorrow this conflict will be over.
@nton_makarenko @arctic_lanes @ChlohardH 100%. The mask over there, too, says that on a historical scale the Russian-Ukraine conflict is only a small point, the sun will go out in a billion years and the most pressing problems.
@ntvru No to implement the Mine Agreements and not bring the conflict to a critical level
@OksanaVirtanen @VStrutinski Yes, and by the way, "open NATO intervention in the conflict will lead to even more escalation, more casualties, and possibly even the use of nuclear weapons.
@olgerd681 @VRSoloviev As if they were being taken to the war zone for provocation. If anything happened to them now, it would be an excuse for NATO to enter a conflict.
@OLukiyanov @chlvk_vagner @dw_russian Let me just explain the order of the numbers. In 2021, Russia's population lost a million people. A million. It's like if the conflict in Donbas continued... 20,000 years. 20,000 years. Is that worth doing? https://t.co/MYN5YfH4Iy?
@Pers0naGrata Artem is always trolling. I think Karpin wasn't gonna invite him. They have an old conflict, and they also have a place on this team for Junba that is questionable. Artem has played the information ahead, but it's better to make it clear that it's against war with Ukraine, not war with Carpin.
@PeseCool Why are we talking about this now so much? Because there's a full-scale invasion, and it's no longer a local war like Donbas, but a full-fledged war that killed more people in two weeks than in eight years of ATO.
@qwertyu67609714 @nfbchdhf2 Direct, conflict of two countries... )
@RFI_Ru You know, our army already has half of Ukraine under control, so it's perfectly safe there, and our country is carrying humanitarian aid, but like francia and stash, for example, supplying military equipment, they want it not to end or what? What do they support the conflict for?
@rianru @Anastia1519 How silly of the hose to drag NATA into a conflict with Russia!
@rianru Ukraine is a priori unable to join NATO as long as there is a military conflict on its territory. As long as there is a LND DNR, or do all Russians want to present, after the conclusion of the separatist world, that this is Russia's credit?

@Skip_SG Denis, I can't agree with you here.
@Skip_SG really, just read the history of Ukraine, the history of our countries' interaction at the state level, not individuals, and realize that conflict, however terrible it may be, is forced and legitimate.
@talking_shit, I don't give a fuck who's fucking who. The most important thing is that it's all done as soon as possible. You can fully respond to Russia so that the conflict doesn't freeze, but it's over. Please, but I don't see any movement from the Ukrainian side right now.
@UnitedNationsRU Everything has been very specific and clear. It is clear that the definition of acts constituting an objective party, an object and a subjective party to war crimes is clear. The rules of international humanitarian law are specified and must be respected by "all those involved in the conflict." UN as always. https://t.co/cedCI9ogKl.
@USApoRusski @POTUS Better - "take care" to immediately stop this artificially created conflict with/in Ukraine. The US must finally resolve and sit at the negotiating table with Russia. Others can join later. Remove immediately all weapons from the conflict zone. Up 2 U
@vasechka_Okay, and the affairs of DNR, LND and Crimea were intervened by Russia (Patoin), precisely in 2014, the great sacrifices were where Putin and Russian volunteers put the fire into the conflict... although there's no point in talking about it now, as I said before, you're not dead here.
@xsucsha @sgorberd Well, at the level of civilizations, the conflict was to some extent inevitable, but it would not necessarily lead to the death of everyone, although the process would be complex. Some characters are no more than some characters, but there is a social immune response, so the world is not doomed)
@zln_sosi Oh, don't give a fuck already. It's just a surprise that people like you support people who just open up this conflict.

Perhaps China, as such a huge machine, has already absorbed enough of the West to start a conflict to lead to closure, so that all of this experience can be digested, but on its own, after a period of openness and exchange of experience, there will always be a period of closure, consolidation.
War conflict we lose when you decide to believe in the news before you can check it out when you choose the worst, most panicky and most unfortunate version of the story.
As a matter of fact, judging by the way they talk about each other, I dare say that their conflict is really over, if not peace, a truce, if there was a mutual aversion in each of their words, it's kind of softer now, maybe I think, but I don't think so. https://t.co/9ufSoadvRe
That's exactly what's happening right now, it's not an inter-ethnic conflict, it's a conflict between law and lawlessness, a 15-year-old daughter understood, but a world deaf in one ear refused to understand, a world that hid weapons behind its back called for peace talks.
