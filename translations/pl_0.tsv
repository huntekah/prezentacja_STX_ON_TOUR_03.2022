@BurmasterCurse @Buckarobanza I'm not behind Zalensky, according to me he's just a murderer because he wouldn't let men leave the country to escape the war. It's like locking people in a cage full of hyenas (Russians). And I also know that he pisses him off that NATO doesn't close the sky, so in anger he calls us

@josiecki @michalplocinski I don't want to pretend to be an expert after one year of postgraduate studies ("I write with the UJ"), but peace support operations may have different forms, and Russian rhetoric (it's not war, it's surgery) can be used against them.
