@1Aemiri No. Refugees from Kharkova are in Lviv, refugees from Mariopoli in Ternopolis. A refugee is running away from trouble. The settler is looking for a better fate in other lands, looking for work in other lands. There are refugees inside and in subjection. Everything is in the U.N. documents. We were kicked eight years ago.
What do you think you're running from?
@50grammmm But. Refugees are very quick not to make a move, cheesy didn't leave moscale.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in God's hands, and all the same on the same tongues.
@Aye092676 I just don't understand who they are... like if they're LDNR refugees, they're either here or on race.
@EngineerKPI The Germans are increasingly saying that they're being treated as refugees and they're getting too expensive, they're also growing fuel prices, they're reducing jobs.
@European Pravda @ukrpravda_news In the meantime, in western Ukraine, which also had to be driven away by refugees, the landlords increase their rents. That is, they don't just put in the clouds, but they increase the prices they set at the beginning of the war when the first wave of refugees arrived.
I don't understand these kinds of messages right now, there are hot lines -- turn around and decide -- I know a lot of times when they're shining for free, and much less market value, and they're just like that -- a lot of refugees are desperate -- but I'm sorry that you have this experience:
@kashiomi_art and you come to someone, or like shelter refugees?

RT @superyurch: Refugees are trouble and their pain and all of us. People help in whatever way they can.
Our refugees from Bushie called the neighbors and told them that the Orcs had covered absolutely all the apartments.
@schildmdn Does the free home mean that refugees are not supposed to clean up and cook food is forbidden?
@uJy9e5cIah8mwB @Continenta So handled, motivates by a lot of refugees, but at the same time relative to moscows, there was no record of such activities. So our refugees are bad and the moscowates are beautiful?
@vlad3956@bramr69 i'm sorry, pigs actually don't let go to a house in Spain, and refugees from Ukraine have a full moral right to do this. The pigs of the Russians must sit in their winters on swamps and moss eaters and berets.
@ZelenskyUa for Ukrainians I am a 37-year-old man who lives in Japan, and I am a member of the family of the dead in World War II, and I have more than two rooms in Utsunomy, Tochihi Prefecture, and I am prepared to serve food and I do not understand words, but I understand pain and suffering.

It is decided that Ukrainian refugees through Ukrainian warfare will be able to obtain long-term visas in Japan without relatives in Japan. Japan is the most peaceful country of dreams in the world. Japan will become a popular place for Ukrainian refugees. https:/t.co/pZQkOhy0Vk
Evacuate from Kharkiv to the coronary region. But: Do not switch to Ukrainian (or, of course) to tell how all "peace" to the Russian audience is to convert prices for them to RUBLI!!!! - Of course, use the term "refuges". What's wrong with it? https:///t.co/GuzDAAlvs http://t.co/Luly847w26

Lithuania has already accepted 14,000 refugees from Ukraine. The selected 2.2 million euros are sufficient to provide refugees by April, and currently more than 10,000 grocery bags have been distributed by Ukrainian refugees in Lithuania:/t.co/O6OttzlSj

The Orcs are now bombing the cities where the refugees from Mariupol are headed and the barracks, the krakova, that's Zaporozhya, that's Vinnyta.
How do we get guns - nain, nain, diplomacy, a truck with יהוה secret to drive squirrels like that?
Also, I have experience with children and older people, Ukrainian books... our refugees need all kinds of help, because most languages don't know, scared, wearing, running from side to side, they can't be drawn... and I'm familiar with this, because it's been 20 years ago that it's been done.
