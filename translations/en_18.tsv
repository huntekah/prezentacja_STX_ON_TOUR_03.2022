@ale_astro_bot @EU_Commission You keep blaming russia, you don't want to put yourself in Russia position with America bring nuclear weapon to their border. This war could have been avoided if the Ukrainian president accept nato neutrality which he has now accepted, after lives has been lost
@AnnieWunderY @strategywoman @TotalEnergiesPR @renaultgroup @SocieteGenerale Indeed, @AUCHAN_France @leroymerlinfr . At least @Danone_EU argues its position upfront, with humanitarian support &amp; suspension of investment, but maintaining production &amp; distribution to "meet the essential food needs of the local population".  Should they pull out completely?

@borkendogguy @Francescovotta1 @OGSamuraiNC @oleksiireznikov @DefenceU Most Europeans learned the lession the hard way! Peace is the only thing what counts. Europe had almost 70 years no greater war. I count Serbia to the EU. Every country has there right winger, besides from Poland and Hungary they are in no position to do anything!!
By taking a reticent position in defending #Ukraine , the US is strengthening the legitimacy of a militarized EU. We should consider the unintended consequences.
@crazycryptoX @Solereum @samfaris8 @jackohum @phildstewart Putin is not as dumb as his trolls are.  He knows that the longer he draws this out, the more cemented EU's position gets towards him.  By basic military logic, Russia does not have enough troops in Ukraine to occuoy it.  Whatever they have is temporary.
Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia PMs are headed to #Kyiv to meet with Zelensky. Georgian PM and his government are suing @Zourabichvili_S for her visits in the EU capitals, which served to position #Georgia closer to the Western policies against #Russia and support #Ukraine.
@DanielaNadj Giving that it will be a number of years before the UK is in a position to reapply for membership of EU, (not Europe, please note). The costs, and conditions for rejoining, maybe more than the UK is willing to bear. Maybe, start considering some tangible benefits for rejoining?

@GregHands I also lived &amp; worked in Germany. I hate Brexit with all my heart, partially because my grandchildren have lost the freedoms that our EU membership brought them. I know you voted for Remain but, nevertheless, why now rub salt in our wounds from your elevated Cabinet position?
@HampshireLawyer @SirJJQC He knows, his position is that this imperative justified agreeing to something they never intended to fully honour &amp; fault according to him lies with May for not negotiating well enough &amp; with EU for not negotiating with desires of Brexiters at heart, so it was all they could do!
he also wants to talk about Donesk status.Only point of contention is the status of Crimea.  Russia is no longer asking for denazification and seems to have no problem with Zerensky.  every reason to reach an agreement.Only point of uncertainty is the position of the US and EU 2)

@jakub_steiner Putin has no reason to strike them. But war is chaos, lots of things happen unintentionally and accidentally. And I don't think anyone was in doubt about the EU/Western position in Ukraine. So I hope there is indeed a political (and not just emotional) benefit
@JyriKimari @karchois I still disagree about NATO being real motive. NATO had rejected Ukraine already. Ukraine even declined to begin process for joining EU because of Russian position years ago.  Of course I don‚Äôt fully understand Putin, but I would still lay all blame for this fully on him.
@LasseNJohansen @joeriwestland 2022 lot of newbuilds coming to market. Illicit trading continues with Russia, in worst case scenario also with Iran. Bearish for US in long term. Geopolitically US is getting to really difficult position. If EU breaks and continues to import Russian oil and gas... wow
@laurnorman @Amb_Ulyanov Nothing is positive about the JCPOA at the moment. Russia/Iran/China are in a win-win position and the US/UK/Germany/EU are in a lose-lose. No deal is bad, signed deal is worse for everyone not running an authoritarian dictatorship or authoritarian theocracy.

@motytchak Morawiecki usually does something completely different than he says. In coming days we can expect some clashes of Poland with EU. Visit in Kiev meant to show the 'pure' intentions, position themselves as good guys. Now they will probably try to force EU to release blocked funds.

@NiallWarry And yet, he has succeeded in putting UK in a better position than EU to deal with CV19 and has a more coherent approach than USA on Ukraine.  His Achilles heel is decarbonisation: he now needs to learn some biochemistry with the same assiduity he applied to the classics.
@Nigel_Farage Do you advocate that the EU Member States cease  buying all Russian fossil fuels?  Is that your position as a former MEP and European Parliament pension recipient?

@thatqueerchris locally, that may be an unsophisticated position, but it is not evidence of hypocrisy or racism. I also think it is counter productive. If it takes the crisis in Ukraine to establish what many have been calling for for years (an effective system involving EU, govts, 3rd sector
