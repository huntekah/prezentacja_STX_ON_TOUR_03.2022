@IsraelThreads in France their geopolitical de Ukraine buffer between Moscow, regardless of president, rhetoric and position. The same is true with the FRN. In strong Ukraine interested in the UB and U.S.
@Jest_Enemy @newstop_us they're not idiots! But they're ready to use a megabruster bomb!
@MirAckerman@laugh_in_pain @oleh_kurza If they are required to participate in Canada, the EU, Taiwan, Japan, etc., it will be stronger than anything else. If you do not know, their position has changed since February 24 (Wan I called "servation" war, for example), and the humanitarian will be shipped away.
@Robin1Tod @Carpe_Snarkum @EmmanuelMacron is such a cowardly position that it's boring! In 1943 the U.S. wouldn't have to intervene, and let Hitler bully France!
RT @Helg409291: Socialmerge has begun the favorite game of the Wraid-Reg. We're formally not members of NATO, but we're now densely integrated in...
@USEmbsyKyiv We condemn, but don't give an ostrich position! Why don't the U.S. recent decades be with the presidents?!
@XBK @tarenko In that and the fact that it's not said. I have no doubt. So it's important to try to reach the U.S. office immediately to press the central office in China (if that's possible). It's necessary to position the company on this question, because many drones are used by the SS.
In social media, there is a favorite game of the ZRIRA Ukrainians. We are formally not members of NATO, but we are now deeply integrated in its structure. Therefore there will be no single agreement of the Greens or Group Council on terms of peace, and there will be a joint position between Ukraine, the United States, Britain, and the EU.
They're not idiots, but the U.S. doesn't give us planes, it doesn't close the sky, it doesn't help us take a--a weird suicide position!
The most dangerous phase of the war against Ukraine is now coming along, writes former U.S. Special Agent Derchepus for Ukraine.
Today, McCon said that he didn't see Ukraine in the EU, Germany was constantly blocking us of some kind of help, the U.S. says that it's not like those Polish fighters are right.
