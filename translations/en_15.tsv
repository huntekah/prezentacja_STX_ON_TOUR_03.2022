A summary of the situation in Ukraine as Russia's invasion enters its 3rd week https://t.co/uP2G6pyxxt https://t.co/tD7JvBnmvx
@albinder @letsblinkit -- please help with me with that. i have served you for a long time, you guyz cannot do this too me on this crisis time. i Have been in a very bad critical situation.
@BarrySheerman It's called multitasking. Our PM is working flat out dealing with a war, a pandemic and trying to tackle fuel crisis and the poverty crisis linked to that amongst a torrent of other issues and all you can do is snipe from the sidelines.  Typical labour, pathetic  &amp; irrelevant.

@busterlucysmom @QuietCacophony6 @Breaking911 You are so right.. peoples stick their heads in the sand &amp; try to ignore what they don’t like. Hopefully this year, with crisis after crises, they will have to peek out.

Cost of living crisis: Scottish unemployment falls over last quarter https://t.co/eGiAziW6x5
@danhill2011 Are you joking!   Brandon Biden couldn’t even get his dog 🐕Commander (now that’s a joke in &amp; of itself) to listen to him. “Come on folks”(🤣) the leaders in Europe won’t take his calls! Besides…he IS the crisis!!!

@DrEliDavid I think that this would definitely cause a crisis of oversupply and prices would drop. All it needs to sudden coordinated mass reaction and voila 🙂

EU to subsidise household fuel prices surging amid Ukraine crisis https://t.co/lqxzbLItCJ
Ezra Klein leads NYT subscribers down a dark alley and then mugs them with reality: https://t.co/o7Ruacn8oU
Fuel could rise as high as £2.50/L for petrol according to experts. These absolutely criminal price rises come while companies make record profits.  People cannot afford to eat, heat their homes, or even travel to their jobs. Fight inflation with socialism https://t.co/BRWg8ELmoX https://t.co/9wOVZpwkAj
@gobaloba @AlistairHaimes Think there might be a grain crisis coming - Ukraine and Russia between them produce around 30% or worlds grain and Ukraine 20% of U.K. cereals. Not happening this year.
@GraphicPro2020 WIP=Unstable Chaos Andrew and Lulu are thrown into the whirlwind of crosshairs, as the face a huge crisis together. They struggle to deal a bad guy who has brought back the past that threatens everyone. It appears someone has a lot to hide and it isn't what they think.
Great recommendations to tackle the housing crisis from @WomensBudgetGrp: - Prioritise social housing - Restore the link between LHA and actual rental prices - Increase the number of women's refuges - Prioritise housing as a fundamental right, not an asset https://t.co/lhhtnBWYL9
He does have final trump card everyone. crisis averted
Heat is on: In Germany an est. 500.000 flats are required to cope with the refuge crisis, pushing pressure at high stakes cities where there is a lack in living-spaces. "As the situation continues to unfold, an estimated 4 million people may flee Ukraine." https://t.co/AJWiEUhoiX

Let's hope @cjcmichel is right about the paradigm shift.  In recent years especially, the UK govt has been more focused on addressing crisis (often of its own making) than enacting structural reform. https://t.co/ZnxYSs9ryW
@MikeDrewWhat @17cShyteposter @Steve_Sailer You're downplaying it. Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest we ever came to nuclear war. Kruschev removed the missiles because if he didn't we would've used military action. Putin seems to me to be acting pre-emptively to make sure a similar missile crisis can't happen in Ukraine
Nigeria feels like a rollercoaster of crisis as almost every sector is heading for a collapse. Yet some of you are rooting for one of the current disastrous leaders, to continue for another 8years. Suffer no dey tire una?!
