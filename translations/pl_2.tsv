@Aettka Ally Putin must have issued security guarantees
@aldehyde10 Where would Putin find such allies.
@AlinaTkaczyk @jakubwiech It's such a building ethos in someone else's tragedy. What happened in the Elysian Palace that suddenly there's no time to "get ready" ?Putin attacked him!??Unless he's been hit by a job-his French company Auchan, Leroy Merlin, Decathlon are doing business in Russia and France is selling weapons
Ambassador of Ukraine to Poland Andriy Despycia: Putin will not stop. There is nothing left to lose https://t.co/85GMoanxPc.. This bastard of the criminal Putin must kill the Russians themselves because he is destroying Russia!!!!!!!
@AndrzejJakubo17 @michaldworczyk @GregZabrisky @MorawieckiM Putin's allies will not shoot.
@Andrzej Mikusze2 Putin told him - he said, "Don't piss off Poles, because more lightning will be sent to Ukraine.
@AnnaZalewskaMEP @EmmanuelMacron @OlafScholz Mrs Anna please don't worry. Putin won't let you hurt Marine Le Pen and Orban's sidekick. For Putin, changing power to pro-European is a disaster and loss of influence.
@A_Parzyszek @JKowalski_postel @Szjadczak @SQNPublishing @KuczynskiG @wPolitytice_pl KGB+criminals have created a system that is the opposite of democracy, decides strength.It is brought to zero-does not have any influence, so Putin attacked because there society grew in power and state also at borders.EU, are corrupted by KGB&gt;Schröder,M.Warnig
@ArturooArtur I think Kaczynski is safe there. Putin will not eliminate his "positive idiot"
@ArturooArtur @zolkaa73 About Kaczyński and Pinocchio is not worth fighting for.Putin would be worried that he lost allies.
Very good @Msygacz material in @PolsatNewsPL . I noticed the words of Owsiannikowa that "only one man is guilty, Putin." And that it still has access to the media. It is significant. It is a struggle for change in Russia that has become dull.
@CarFace_io. God forgive me but the suffering of innocent children is impossible to look at. Forgive me for the joy of such a view although Putin should be there but it is what it is.
@cezarysztopa These are the high standards of "European" elites. These are jars that allowed themselves to believe that it is possible like Putin to step on someone, wish him death, illness. This is the whole @TVN24 message of the largest message of the Kremlin in Poland
@ Skinny_Boyfriend There's nothing to decide. Everyone sees Putin as a criminal
means soon more attacks on civilians #putin, #UkraineUnderAttack https://t.co/1SFDj9LXuV
@DariuszRosati What is led by communism dressed in liberalism showed Putin, and you better not speak about the Poland you betrayed. https://t.co/LKKbZNIBqx
@Darth_is_Vader @InformationUSB Whatever mission is of course a dream, Kaczyński can say to himself, it has no impact on NATO's real activities. However, in terms of communication it is not a stupid pressure and grain of uncertainty towards Russia (but they will not consider it).
And the former Putina wants to talk to Prime Minister Kaczyński in Smolensk.Oj sie petla tightens up.Putin of you will make such a ch.. like Kiszczak from Wałęsa.The https://t.co/2jrmsAz8wI
How much did Putin pay you or promised you for harming Poland and Poles . . . .You are a traitor to a nation raised on a Putin's breast... to lie, to lie, and if a lie doesn't work, to turn the cat's tail.
@donaldtusk Will you stop pissing on Poland? How much does Putin and Gerhard Schröder pay you?
@Dorota_2017 @BartSienkiewicz those planes that kill women's children in Ukraine equipped Tusk and Macron and the whole fucked-up EU! https://t.co/YLGZ83TzWM
@Dorota_2017 @BartSienkiewicz Tusk and Macron consider that creating a T-shirt and a beard on Zalensky will wash away from them the friendship with Putin and selling weapons to Russia despite the embargo imposed in 2014. This weapon is now used in the war.This weapon kills! This is "lawful" in the EU! https://t.co/YLGZ83TzWM
@Wonsz Wonsz For Intelligence purposes. So far there has been no Kremlin agent in the vicinity of President Zeleniński and Putin decided to change that.
Today at the grochowski market, I learned the real cause of Putin's attack on the AU. He did it so that the Ukrainians would take our job. Putin hates Poles, not Ukrainians. And another person, at the same market said that they didn't want to work at all.
@EasyRid04682094 Putin will, yes, escalate and play hawk, but he has no resources for such a great operation and these "letters" completely ignore it.
@Ewe____Lina @OnetNews I also think it does. Poland has the most screwed up. Sam Putin said he was going to attack us soon because Poland has part of his land... I wish I had been paying attention to History because I don't know what part it is.
@FilippFilipovic @ValentinaShim You really are such fools and don't you see Putin is a murderer? https://t.co/dJwN91X6MQ
@hannagw A Putin let your wealth hide .our health minister who was in Moscow after the plane crash in Smolensk disappear as soon as possible.
Hitler was convinced of the mission of building the great Germans, Putin mastered by the idea of rebuilding the empire. This man will not go back until he gets "aunt in the nose" or realizes his intentions.
Why do you think @Anna_Mierzynska left out there a thread of the forecasts of the impact of refugees on health care or the availability of apartments for students in large cities? Anyone who talks about this "sews Russian content"?! #Ukraine #refugees #war #warnaukrain #Russia #Putin https://t.co/uxtbcHgDcW
@jasiol7 @lapszynski IMO Putin did not wage war, he wanted to forcefully impose political solutions beneficial to himself/Russia. In my opinion, nothing has changed at the moment, the purpose of this war is peace. Putin cannot retreat, he cannot occupy the whole of it enough strength, so he plays for something in between.
@JkmMikke Writing JE in front of Vladimir Putin these days is more pathetic than your election results over the past 30 years.
@karol03300 @donaldtusk I refer all the time to your selective perception of facts. You should know that if the opposition had not acted, we would have left the European Union and thus Putin could have even attacked us and Ukraine at the same time.
@Karol_t_sz @TheCejrowski In the case of Ukraine, someone has not completed the formalities the question why? After all, Ukraine has aspirations to belong to the European Union and NATO, so much so the UN did not? Find out who screwed it up because innocent people are dying and Putin still thinks Ukraine is a Russian zone.
Komorowski praises Morawiecki and Kaczyński: This gesture will make a good impression https://t.co/hd0jyFrom6cy
@Krzyszt07669515 @JkmMikke Such visits are important. Physical presence in the threatened area. No one is afraid of Russia, Ukraine has support etc. Why should only your Putin be able to chess?
@LaszloUolleh @MaciejBk1 @_omboral These are the only premiers in the Union that have nothing in common with Putin. Unfortunately, for the rest of Putin has a hook and pulls strings.
@lis_tomasz NATO should have been in Ukraine long ago and driven away the Russians. But unfortunately they have no eggs and Putin uses it and will continue to use it.
@lis_tomasz Schröder is missing as an advisor in the ARS and the "editor " is lost. Ask your friend Gerhard.This friend from Russia. Putin will gladly tell you who to criticize and who to admire.
@Macdac @AlaNo fanatics about train safety and content I'm not worried about. Kaczyński's presence is a guarantee. Putin of a useful ally will not touch. I'm worried about Żeleński because these idiots can expose him.
@Maciejevski @Jzef00259048 Any raids, shooting rockets? Did Putin get so scared that he banned? https://t.co/IyGifZkBV
@MAKowalczyk Wot, durak - thought Putin.
@Maniek8 @radio_357 They died but the analogy is very far-fetched! It was Iraq that attacked Kuwait, the ISis gangs were hiding in Afghanistan... no one invaded a foreign country from such an extortioned excuse as Putin.

@M_Bobz @Koloproctologi1 @michalplocinski It will end Putin and the world will return to business, and you will continue to write and accuse your traumatic bohomases of what a bad world this is...
@michaldworczyk @MON_GOV_PL @MSWiA_GOV_PL Putin disorganized the whole German foreign policy and the continental option. The government in Berlin is subject to pressure from public opinion and various interest groups. Therefore, in the Polish Republic you can notice the panic behaviour of orphans after this construction.
@michalkarnowski Duma extends such heroes, Putin already shit his pants like our beloved eternal virgin president. https://t.co/MXi58cCiF7

@TomaszMczyski2 @ja707 @Gasiuk_Pihowicz Putin also saw "a lot of pathology in the judicial sphere" as well as media. Now courts and media are vasalized.

@TomaszUrbas The psychicity of the Lord will also give me a heart attack. However, this time I think that: 1. Putin will not risk conflict with NATO today because he has to seriously verify the current capabilities of his army. 2. Excellent results in Poland achieves low-cost extra-military methods.
@tynxik NATO Mission in Ukraine marks the beginning of the Third World War. The duck would like to hold NATO and the EU responsible even though Putin hit his neighbor.

Everyone talks and writes about a trip to Kiev. Don't be afraid. The best guarantee of the safety of the train is Kaczyński's presence on board. Putin won't move a useful ally.
