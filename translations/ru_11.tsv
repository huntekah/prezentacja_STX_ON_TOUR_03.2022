@garr_the_master @castet demilitarization, denationalization, off-block status 404. Move NATO borders to the 1991 borders (or, I don't remember, 1997), remove nuclear weapons from the euro. These are stated targets.

@jojohater87 @dweisa @koletsya paid politically, economically.Racism, the teaching of true history, "degradation." Freedom is valuable, so criminals and their supporters do not belong at large. Deimperiation, demilitarization, reparations, forced demonstration of war crimes in Ukraine is needed.
@KremlinRussia @CzarSays @MD_RF ...What compromise?!!!!!! So that in two or three years the bandits will come to power again?! ... Stalin and Hitler would be looking for copromiss, yeah.

@ru_rbc Bombed the most Russian-speaking cities, so she's Zombie denacification.
@ru_rbc Reading comments, wondering why you assholes are different from fascists, Nazis, Banderians? That's where denacification is needed.
@sans_url @mich261213 When denacification is finished, then it's gone, a little bit left.
@skiween_Yeah, how is denacification going in Ukraine? Be careful not to get caught.
Have you changed your mind?

As a result of the war, Ukraine is awaiting not only de-nationalization, but de-oligarchization and nationalization, a political scientist, Yuri Podvelka, has been convinced, and there is no reason not to agree with him.

Today, the Rascists launched an air strike on Berdichev, a hometown where I spent the first ten years of my life, a special city for Jews from all over the world, once called Volyn Jerusalem, a place of power for all the Jews who come every year.
An ambulance train to the house is coming home as the bird came, as a bird, I took off the chases and the loops, and I've already had enough of Denacification.
