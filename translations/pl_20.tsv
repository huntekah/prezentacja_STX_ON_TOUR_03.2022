On March 11th - unfortunately, the decline seems to have ended... from a few days ago a similar number of diseases every day. Traditionally, we cite data on the number of hospitalizations, infections and deaths of COVID-19 in Wałbrzych, county, Lower Silesia and Poland. https://t.co/qItpRcKlah https://t.co/9eiiSfMkwn
Bielsko-Biała+Pow.bielski #COVID19 #BielskoBiała Wer. number of cases per 100 thousand people/7 days: B-B 16
@HalikRafa The number of diseases during all waves and the fact that Ukraine's nut peak shows that despite low vaccination their wall of immunity is similar to ours. Worse with tuberculosis, etc. https://t.co/jtNul8Fnh9
the number of diagnosed cases of seasonal flu. Interestingly, WHO changed the definition of pandemic, just before the pandemia of the so-called swine flu in 2009. Previously, the condition of pandemic was high number of deaths. PCR tests with high number of cycles (35-45)
@k_piesiewicz Unfortunately, the number of diseases on Covid continues to increase.Fear what will be the autumn.
@mmigalski Extremely perceptive. Please check whether the number of diseases and deaths has increased since the outbreak of the war. In such a situation, logical growth would be if the war caused the amulets to be removed from the face.
@placzekgrzegorz @MarysiaBarylska @MZ_GOV_PL @a_Niedzielski @MorawieckiM They still operate the number, but only positive tests, not actual infections and diseases.

Rockets fall 16 km from the border with Poland and few other topics in the mind than safety. Meanwhile, Covid doesn't give up. In China, the record number of diseases for 2 years and if it goes further like Hong Kong, we have even greater problems with supply chains.

Ukrainian health care system has led to an uncontrolled increase in the incidence of particularly dangerous and economically significant infections. Consequently, the number of cases of rubella, diphtheria and tuberculosis has increased in Ukraine.
@Viciu13 @MichalDtk @placzekgrzegorz @KPRM_CIR @MorawieckiM What did you want to treat covid besides oxygen?Just don't tell me about placebo, like amantadine. How was the flu? Is it so hard to check? https://t.co/FYnMBL6gsk
In Germany, health at the conference wonders what measures are being taken to protect itself from the increasing number of diseases again. It talks about the Delta variant that has already appeared in the USA. Does anyone know what the Polish health min. is doing??https://t.co/v5LzXhFP5u
