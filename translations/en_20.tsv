@a__random__dude @kjoules @mrlanevox @goldencaskcap @tripperhead That is in absolute numbers, but the number of cases in SG is less likely to be under-reported, while HK almost certainly had a lot more cases than what have been reported. Taking those into account, the numbers for HK are more justified.
@a__random__dude @kjoules @mrlanevox @goldencaskcap @tripperhead Yeah, deaths are almost surely not under-reported. Pretty sure it's mild and asymptomatic cases that are under-reported, which makes the absolute number of deaths look like a lot for the number of reported cases.

@cshperspectives @Bob_Wachter Number of cases is a useless indicator by now. For example, last time I checked the CDC data, hospitalization/cases was like 30% in my county. So either we should be really afraid, or hardly any cases are making it into the official numbers.
@DanielAndrewsMP "A return to precautions such as mandatory face masks &amp; density limits may be needed, experts say, after Vic recorded its highest number of new COVID-19 cases in five weeks, driven by the more-infectious BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron."  But, yay, foodie.  https://t.co/cc7SlATa2B

@discoball2000 @DavidSteadson @hutcho66 It's going to be less tiny. Anyway, I take his point that mass infection in China would mean a large number of deaths in *absolute* terms even in the best of cases. If that's all he meant, I guess I agree.
Does the US have so few cases because they just aren't testing/reporting? Because they still have a steady (awful) number of people dying. https://t.co/cB1ztKxgqe
Don’t go telling me the Government doesn’t have a plan for reducing the number of Covid cases https://t.co/b6JEXGrK8O
@drizzleanddip It’s not just the cost of the test, it’s the worry of catching Covid before you travel and then testing positive. You literally need to be a hermit for 2 weeks before you travel with the high number of cases here, which is not usually possible!
@EssexPR I mentioned it’s unclear what % are incidental. We really need that data as with cases rising the number of deaths will obviously rise. 500-600 deaths per week is not insignificant. Far worse then flu.
Even today, the number of cases counted by the 6pm mark was around 375,000 cases.  I definitely wish the ruleset was different to allow remote play, but as someone who has COVID rn, it's very difficult to talk, let alone focus on something for an extended period of time.
