@cryptoawos @Mikey_Satoshi @profMarekBelka Why voted against? After all, from BTC (and other cryptovalut) we pay BELKA tax!
@cryptoawos @profMarekBelka I don't like M.Belka- but what you write about saving lives by crypto is very far-fetched. Life saves vest, medicine, etc. And no, they're not bought for crypto, only for fiats obtained from selling crypto. Find where you can pay for vests via BTC?
@CryptoNewbiePL @MaciejTomczyk3 Right, cool. I've been out there since yesterday Cro-Usdc. Btc would be afraid to sell and throw on the farm because the risk is greater. Diversification.

Good morning. Last week was very busy. First the event, then the trip. Slowly I'm coming back to life. $BTC 38612$.Index F&amp;G 21 points, so we're already on a similar level. On Sunday at $0.94 I sold all my $MMF - I didn't think it would top 1$
Today's listing #ZebecProtocol count on a good score. On #Solanium start records for #DragonWar. #ByBit adds a pair of $PAXG / $USDT. #KryptoThe team announces cooperation with #Zetly. $BTC 39K$. Good Wednesday Day! #Cryptalluty #Crypt #Bitcoin #Crypt #Bitcoin
@FrustratZone @smoQ_u @piotr_rataj You will have to look, but I don't think it will work without a strong correction this month. There will be a miracle if we stop at 30k so that then there will be growths until May. Let's hope so. With a lot of correction the market may fall a few days, a week, so not so fast the alts will fly, btc so
Where were all these "zaffcy" market , how Jasmy flew his head to his neck ? Now there is already enthusiasm , remember HODL , this coin in the future will not depend on Btc . Check out this project and collect in the future powerful growths . #cryptalluty #btc #jasmy #gleda #investments #
@GregTyminski @piotr_rataj From what I've noticed, BTC draws the reverse graph to the dollar index. Now the dollar is at the top of the bar. I bet it won't last long there and will start downhill. So it turns out that the battleship now counts its low valuations.
@guy_anonym And what do you think of these foot increases? On the stock exchange it works on the declines, but interesting how BTC will behave, mostly BTC is correlated with S&amp;P and Nasdaq, so they can start pulling BTC also down.
Interesting night rally on #BTC at night. Anyone, anything? https://t.co/AmNcvtX7Jn

If the FED raises the feet, I'm waiting for a lower price of BTC. If it doesn't raise the feet, it's ALL IN BTC.
@KO_Kryptoluty Silence before rainbows. By the end of the year I count on at least $70k per btc. Such my HOPIUM, hopefully not only for HOPIUM is over.
@Lukasz_Fijolek will be some update on YT with BTC and ETH ? greetings
@MaciejTomczyk3 And that's what it's all about, some people get excited about what $BTC will do and others passively earn 24 hours a day and build their passive wallet. I like to fall asleep thinking that my passives earn even when I sleep #passiveincome #CronosChain
I have the impression that a lot of people think that #btc will be "pumped" again around 43k, but because I know how it works and what emotions I feel in my bones that soon we will fly hard, now distribution and some whales are selling out for loss.
@Marek90278065 @PhilNeedle No, however, earned a BTC for it earned in training;)
@MarekStiller I remember that time. Up until now I spit in my beard that I didn't withdraw my capital from the stock exchange and packed it in btc, instead I only did it with part of the capital.

There's no market force up the BTC, so we're going to assume a 40.4k short with a 39k target, but I'm watching because I might move it to 33k.

@PiotrOstapowicz BTC and ETH so far without frenzy, on the CAKE and FTM target, but still a little bit more...
@PiotrOstapowicz I buy there gradually. Today, for example, 10% of stables will fly to BTC.
@PiotrOstapowicz Tomorrow at the 19th FED meeting so the btc course will go crazy up and down again
@PiotrOstapowicz Buys regularly every week for more than 4 months, $BTC (30 UAH) +$ETH+$BNB+$HBAR (after 20 UAH). The time horizon has been taken at least 5 years, and probably reach 10 - then my children will be approaching 20 ;)
@PiotrOstapowicz I buy every week after 25euro BTC and eth if (Ma &gt;30, and fear grey index&gt;30) and also 50euro.in USC for inheritance -20% in week BTC eth and some opportunity for cheap alta.
@PiotrOstapowicz I buy regularly, once a week, but only $BTC and $ETH. Bitcoin may never sell.
@PiotrOstapowicz We fly 100 thousand per BTC which was to take place in 2021
@PiotrOstapowicz Similarly, every week BTC + ETH and selected alta: SOL DOT ADA BNB LINK + selected alt However, looking at the market I wonder whether not to play on the declines
@PiotrOstapowicz I start with small capital (for the moment I have uploaded 600 zł of which part is and will be added to eth and btc with possible partial realisation of profits every now and then, in addition, I spent 200 on alt learning and somehow ~15$ I am ahead of what they showed me that the plan is a challenge.
@PiotrOstapowicz You inspired me and flies every week dca btc/eth.
@piotr_rataj And when it comes to BTC, are you already buying or still waiting?
@piotr_rataj Btc + Eth, a percentage less profit than on alts, but at least a quiet head, in the long term
@piotr_rataj What do you think of BNB? I hold a bit of this - I look forward to a better ratio of BNB/BTC to transition.
@piotr_rataj Everything sold long ago. Only btc
@piotr_rataj That's why at this stage we're not sure what's likely to survive: btc eth ltc
@piotr_rataj Exactly why I came out of everyone leaving only a little of these "tested" better safe 70%BTC 25%ETH, and on alta leftovers....
@piotr_rataj Exactly how someone spoke to me to reason about a month ago. I wanted a DCA polakadot, chainlink, salted etc. Now I'm looking rather at a table and BTC, the rest will wait for another altcoin season. I'll be able to join you in time.
@piotr_rataj How something shows sells to btc.
@piotr_rataj First ;) I come out of a luna bought on average at $14. I'm still swinging unfortunately with ltc at $140 Rest of eth and btc 50/50
@piotr_rataj I expected 28-29, and it bounced first from 32, then from 34. Also 25 seems unlikely. Too much awareness of BTC values among large players.
@piotr_rataj all in all.. 273mil.. ? with coinbase flew over billion in btc. a few days ago
Almost all shorts opened on #Bitfinex 4 days ago, have been closed (or partially eliminated) in the last 48h...
