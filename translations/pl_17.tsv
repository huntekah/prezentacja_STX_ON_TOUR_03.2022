@adamSlap adam, traitor, you have heard that the entire narrative about violating the rule of law in Poland is a Russian provocation. This is the official position of the US. We will see who will be doing folksdojcz services now.
@AdrianHofmannXX @m_ignatowska @Sejmowa Israel has denied these reports. Besides, Israel has an interest in not coming near Russia - Syria. Hence I would not count on a clear position on their part, and at the same time will not support Russia, because on the other hand they have the US.
@alternatywy_TT And this text is true, but some will still work the denial mechanism, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to reality in which probably with the help of the USA will soften the position of Fr or DE with regard to the rule of law etc... we will have a comedy festival:)
The Americanization of Polish cracks has so advanced that it does not allow self-thinking and excludes its own position on the mission of Russia in Ukraine, is guided by a ram's momentum like the stand of American buffaloes under U.S. propaganda in TVN.
@andrzejc Yes, I am a troupe boy, I draw knowledge from movies and books. However, I assume that if in the US a judge's position is a career ending, and with us becomes a piss on the app... the quality of our judges is worse than there...
@ArturRoland @PAInformation The position of the Polish government #Morawiecki ends with appeals and support of the #US decision and leaving the door open for cooperation with democratic #Russia in the future #EmbargoOnRussianGas https://t.co/Ldo90YYu78
@cezarysztopa Small correction: a person who, as a result of electoral fraud, takes the position of Vice President of the United States.
what is happening was certainly agreed with the US, as evidenced by NATO's position.
@covax_ @DRatka1 Generally on some issues, the US position is not flexible at all. And this is probably one such issue.
Do you know that Margaret Thatcher is the only woman to act as President of the United States. Her name was Irish Lady because of her Italian background. In 1998 she had to leave her post due to the scandal of her affair with Russian opera singer Placido Domingo. https://t.co/E9o3brYnxe
@dariuszw771 @Exen @MorawieckiM We, in the eyes of the United States, depend on our security. Ours is from them and not the other way around. Simply. Trying to play with the United States with the method of facts made (instead of negotiating with them first) ends as you can see.
@DziennikPL was quite right if Poland had taken such a position, today Germans and the US would have encouraged us to deliver weapons to Ukraine together, and so we were left alone.
@WEI @tomaawroblewski @SebStodolak @p_palutkiewicz Your position looks like a US propaganda tube. It's time to think about the future of the guys, BRICS is 6 billion people, and the Eurodolara system is failing, nothing will stop it. Real war is going on in the background, two economic systems are just rubbing off.
@Gracja_ @VP @POTUS @AndrzejDuda The Pentagon's statement on our proposal clearly shows what the US stand is for NATO's participation in this conflict. So there is nothing left but to stay out of it.
@handloviec FT and Washington Post like to put in the oven at the right time. Tomorrow the meeting of US and China diplomats so it might as well be a light media game. We'll probably wait tomorrow to see what position China will take tomorrow.
@handloviec And one more thing - in the last week we had some kind of merry-go-round around MIGs. We wanted to give, we were afraid, we tried to manipulate the situation of the United States and Germany by the method of facts made, we did not agree, we had to take back the position of our own MFA. In short. And question: 1/2
@hoppyalien @Efes09307128 @MarcinPalade will get nothing at our expense. Currently they are against the wall. They must agree to what the West offers. And the position of the USA is unambiguous - Poland belongs to NATO and lies in our sphere of influence, Article 5. is in force. And if you don't fuck it up.
@Innnaa13 @LukaszBok The U.S. position has made it clear that Taiwan is the most strategically important and that everything in the EU is a supporting action. They need weak Russia, that's a fact, but they think sanctions are a sufficient tool. That's pretty much what I think it looks like.
@ItsNotEasyBut2 @WydBialyKruk Her statement informs what is the official position of the U.S. government in the dispute about really stupidity. We are not racists, the rule of law does not deviate from the norm in relation to other EU countries. One thing we have is a strong opposition that screams as if they were murdered.
@JacekGadek @StZerko It seems, however, that his movements are mostly an attempt to rebuild his image in the eyes of the United States and seek a post after the end of his 2nd term. He will apply for a high position in the United Nations, NATO or a similar organization with a strong position in the United States.
@jacek_Libera The drag-off effect between the EU and the US on Iran, due to games in Israel for a position concerning the AU (capitulation - EU/RFN vision or strong support - US), Bennett and Lapid.
@JacekWronaCBS Now we will find out what the U.S. administration is planning . 1. Express outrage and sharpen the position . 2 . Or . Forbid traveling in Ukraine , i.e. planning a deal with Putin . 3. Nothing will do , waiting for what people will say . We'll see what happens ;)
@Jerzy49420918 If the Poles had reason and not sawdust in their head, they could only benefit from taking a neutral position towards Russia and using their geographical location by trading with both sides. So far, it is sanctions on Russia that only the United States imposes on Russia.
@KeMaciej @kunc_t If there was a position of the armed forces there it was rather so. Besides, the US bombarded unevacuated hospitals in Afghanistan or Syria, so they probably shouldn't be disturbed by it.
@KLubnauer @RGrupinski @KoneserUnion I honestly believed that something had changed after 24, but from the opposition still defending (or at least justifying) the position of the Netherlands, Germany, USA (as far as migi is concerned) but never of Poland in these disputes
#CryptoFebruarys, such as #bitcoin and other digital assets represent a significant risk to investors of pension accounts 401.2.1k).This is the position of the Department of Labour #USA. https://t.co/zk7ZfxcQuJ #pension
@krzachor_e @Dorota_2017 @AlKaJaCi @EdiN93913239 @KamalaHarris What did he do for 2 years? Today the PIS challenged fundamental human rights. What is the U.S. position on this issue? Because for human rights in Ukraine, they want to drag Europe into war. I'm listening to what they did ?
@krzysztofbosak After all, she is, to say the least, unbalanced. The plexus of many cases has made this position, Dyzma from the USA. JB is a strong man with her... In other words, no matter how she behaves, important to brings to her
@LBalcerowicz Either the government wanted to have US support silbe, or to burn the subject, what just happened. You see, we want to help, but the US won't allow it. Public disclosure has made NATO, the US and the Pentagon stand public. What would happen if these were top secret conversations?
@lis_tomasz Kaczyński is not stupid enough to say such things without knowing what the U.S. position is in this case.
@lpivro @Vimis23 @MarekTatala @K_Paczkowski NATO and the USA have the same position as my position. Hence, the west is a Confederacy. Well, if the facts disagree with reality, the worse it is for facts.
@LukaszBok Interesting if China agrees will be the position of the USA and nato I wonder if it will not come out of this something like a war in Korea
@LukaszKohut But Polish democracy does not give a shit. What is the position of the US and @VP on the scandalous verdict of TK Julia Przyłębska? Are they kidding? They will defend democracy in Ukraine and what about us? A bunch of hypocrites.
@macmil71 What the U.S. stand against Russia looks like, we saw during the war in Syria. The genocide that the Kremlin committed there was appalling.
@MichalSzczerba Yes it is true. We look forward to a strong position and decisions on this matter USA, UK, DE and FR. We look forward to NATO's decision and urgent delivery of weapons.
@MigKKRP Ambassador is not from such things to notice. I mean, he is, but for his government. Outside he is to represent and present the position of the U.S. government, not private. And besides, I did not notice that he especially spoke about the rule of law in PL.
@m_subscriber I do not have certainty, but the last fitting of the PL diplomacy for the USA to pass the migi through Ramstein suggests that the US does not want to openly enter into conflict - i.e. something would have to happen with ABC weapons in order for Biden to change his position
The U.S. took a position far from what was expected because it smelled bad, and Russia is still taking over Ukraine. https://t.co/SYBeRRqJhJ
@P0LACTomek I don't know if they have to give permission. Things have gone too far and you can see that the U.S. position is different just a few months ago. Pure deal. We from Yankees weapons, power plants etc. they permanent bases and security guarantees. I don't know each other, we'll see.
@Peruk08657624 @fail @copone1dak I do not want to interact with this professor, but I am curious if one of the symptoms of art destruction recognizes the restitution of about 500 works of art and is this also the position of Jegiellonian University, supposedly the best in Poland and in general with US scholarships?
@PetrosTovmasyan Of course he is preparing for this position. Ambassador in Israel now in the USA.

@rafwroc @C_Kazmirczak As unreal as NATO is supposed to enter this war. It is not a problem. Biden builds its credibility. NATO does not seem to enter into this clash. The certainty and unity of the alliance is more important than the defence of Ukraine. And this is not just the U.S. position.
@R_A_Ziemkiewicz This will of course be the case, but the U.S. position will be crucial.

@SKozii @Purple1 And you allow yourself, General, to think that the position of the U.S. excluding the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine is that they have intelligence that you do not have access to and that this is an excessive risk?
@STANISA00912728 TVN is an American, i.e. TVN u position is a U.S. position. So biden gives Ukraine to Putin
The position has already been taken by the Chinese Embassy in Washington https://t.co/DwKFAMPD5F
@Shimoch Government position I understand, but the way we communicate with certain things when we haven't agreed with anyone is childish. I've already explained the position of the United States a thousand times.
@Tash_Witk supposedly U.S.A. promised PAD a position in NATO. Or the UN. So PAD makes a face and I won't say anything here. Hi
@Tommwenty @michalszynki @s_staszewski Because you don't have to say it. The United States went to wars, joined the defense of other countries and couldn't call NATO. Poland would do the same and from the slot machine, it would also delete itself from this possibility. It was not an understatement. It was a clear position that the United States had since the beginning of this war.
@ToommmFalcon I'm still wondering why Borell had this information that he blurted out. Because after the Pentagon was revealed he was against it, it's understandable. At the same time I read that the position of Dep.The U.S. state was incompatible with the Pentagon. Hence it's "green light."
@TrompBK @DrabinskiAriel @RemigiuszWilk In Iran I don't believe because there is too much to say about Israel - it affects the position of the US and also a lot of sympathy for Russia.

@USAmbPoland @profGrodzki What is the position of the US Embassy, for yesterday's ruling of an illegal Constitutional Tribunal, challenging the decision of the ECHR on the right of Poles to an independent court, and turning Poland into a dictatorship like Putin Russia ? Any comment ?
@wiekrol @PolsatNewsPL The Germans left the Netherlands ahead for the test and research but the position is synchronized. There will be no Ukraine or other new members before the attempt to federalize the EU. The war will absolutely be used to push the US out of Europe.
@AllDeadmyl @kjulkaa @WBC241 It's not those times that you can quietly, there's no chance of that. The U.S. position is clear and Taiwan is not Ukraine - the landing can be done in a few hours and it closes the case for a good few years.
Yoon Suk-yeol, new president, is preparing for close-up with the US, return to the atom and tougher position towards the DPRK. https://t.co/h8mrtwWwNn
@ZuKaJo9 Never mind, he won't be president anymore. He doesn't play the voters of Poles. He now plays the U.S. i.e. he's hoping for a position in NATO, the U.N. or any other, and he must have US support, and he won't have it if he's still slashed.
So that #NATO does something and #EU doesn't, it's also an example that the EU is also taking a position. https://t.co/ozrLdwPJmF https://t.co/A2EaXFN9ot
