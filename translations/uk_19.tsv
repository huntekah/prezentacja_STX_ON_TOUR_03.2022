introduces additional sanctions against individuals contributing to President Putin's illegal invasion in. References below (Only English and French) https://t.co/bUVrH8Cbh
@24tvu Opa, and here's the division for the export of the forest from Russia.
@Alcia26064694 I'm not going to be harmed by such an episode. I'm looking forward to the month of May or June, when the sanctimonies are shot by idiots. Then I'm going to have real fun!
@apple_incoor for the last four years she's been living in a subservience, and after a full-scale invasion, she recorded a tearful video with her primary "let's stop." Why are we stopping? We're being attacked? We're not exactly now, and yesterday she's got an RF sancture and she's not going to be able to make any money anymore.
@astafrey @pepsi_z_vjshn @_leya_leya what you can't even sanctum in the frame just want to fight each other, not go and ask the power what the fuck is)
@bookazoid_There at 600+ swarms, which are definitely going to be from the "journeys" -- the cake just saves its property in the ES and the bank account somewhere else.
@CabanOleg remember one thing: They have their own interests, they will be above ours! They will shit on conscience, on humanity and the U.S.
@chastime needs to enter sanctions against the Chinese because he wants to get the military criminals out of the sanctum
@Denys_Shmyhal @UKRINFORM @MorawieckiM @P_Fiala @JhansaSDS And call out the lane that sanitation will be destructive to his country.
@dmrdy @peachxsoju for how old are you, child? You're arguing about nothing. What do you prove to us without knowing how sanitation works and what the dollar rate is at all?
@_marba_But Ukraine did not recognize the Belarusian elections, Luku with the so-called president, and was not diplomaticly involved. What sanctions were needed? Do we have to stop trading? We haven't stopped the country completely in eight years... again in the misery of the neighbor of Ukraine.
To create an illusion of opposition to the west, like how poor Russians, are worse off than thousands of killed and still alive Ukrainians, loosen the sewers. (2) It's completely propaganda: the Russians are innocent, the Russians are guilty of nothing but a chain. (200 thousand army is also made up of one path!) &gt;&gt;
@hellcat_staties And half-material microphones end, and new sanitations are not missed.
@Kokra4307521 Fisca is not that their problems are being minimized, believe me, there's a bunch of people who will support them, but it's definitely not a problem of Ukrainians, it's not in our position to remember all the Russians who suffered from sanitation.
@KivIndendent Chinese Huawei, who rebelled against the United States, came under sanctions and fell out of the service zone of leading companies. Chinese entrepreneurs are going to suffer from bankruptcy or arrest.
@LostInBombas @saver_ag The Google has come the same way. Also, if the Donetsk district is a change of registration because of sanitation. I did not understand it.
Well, my personal sanctions spread to them too! Of course, a small loss, but I believe there will be so many of us!
@pinkertosh especially when sanctions are finally full of pack, good luck living there
@RadistTvoa @alex9antenko @OSlobidska @Podolyak_M I understand your falling in love with NATO, but the tanks are full of fresh French heating gears and boshech equipment. French journalists have already come up with a weapon supply from the FR to 148ml. Do you really need such friends?

@So_10 If she was repentant, she wouldn't trade purples about bro-nations or adinnatroths (I don't remember it anyway). There's nothing done by extremism or news coming in. It's a decree to show that simple arms aren't so bad and that's why they need to relax their sanitation.
@Sofia_Sexhop P is not easier to grab Russian passports by hand, and sanctions are already entered against sly pigs with 2.3 of my passports.
@UKRinJPN Russia falls under sanctions from different countries. I would like to honor Ukrainian soldiers who fight without sleep at night. I can only say I will do my best for those fighting Russia.
"Avato:" paralyzed - the company sends all employees to a long "release" because of sanitation. The reason for the lack of assemblyers that used to come from abroad has already increased the price of "pity" to about 10%. https:/t.co/oFu8kNkOu
"AvatoWAY" paralyzed -- the company sends all employees to a long "release" because of the sanctions -- and the reason why the lack of assembly people that used to come from abroad -- is that the cost of being proud has increased by about 10%, and there will be no bolts, either.
Great Britain declared new sanctions against Russia https://t.co/qZVJQgAax through @YouTube
The E.U. has established sanctions against large defense companies of the RF, as well as יהוה Naftogas companies, but there is a phrase in the text that allows you to buy oil and gas from companies under the sanctages ? https://t.co/X5zHlvtMMC
For the most part, sudden locking has happened with direct sanctions. https://t.co/NQw8h0x8Q
Even if it's really not a way to go around the sanitation or not to focus and she's out herself, I'm not going to apologize to her yet and especially after she's starting to wipe out about the fraternities eto war valevique and bile breede.
Do not mix our sanctions... https://t.co/cwe0X5FlDw
New sanctifications are being introduced in Great Britain. The operations have exported to the export of luxury goods and introduced an additional 35% to the valid imports of a number of products, such as vodka. The glasses will now drink their vodka! #

SACTIONS Short Course for Teaguests This is the expected result from entering sanctices, both personal and sector with the aim of placing the performance economy in general? https://t.co/OTvDTz0TQ
The only thing that has to be done is to make sure that in the next few years, 100 don't have the money to go to Turkey, only a tour of the gold ring.

It's a pity that Russia has a sanctimony on Bayden, and he's so eager to see personally the herd of stupid rams who believe in SPECAPATION, NOT PATTERIST, and PUTINE MALADEC.
If one day, we'll all be Ukraine's sanctions: https://t.co/njAW7OdTJ
