@Amb_Ulyanov The sanctions that have been imposed on you are the response to your atrocities and aggression against https://t.co/ANEXSOsNBN punishment for your genocide and the Nazi oppression of the Ukrainian population. If you want to blame someone for the sanctions imposed, it is on Putin's side.
For the hundredth time, American sanctions completely destroyed the torn economy of gas stations, transforming the country.
@Andruszkiewicz1 This is what the French EU rule of law looks like. Penalties! Penalties! Sanctions! https://t.co/eCHq9hnk0U
@AnnaMarch5 @ASwirido @patryciusztyga @katarinaa What sanctions did the Germans not agree to? And so I will insert... https://t.co/LpOZVsrZCc
@ArturooArtur And the harsher sanctions are what have they been, the ban on trade with Russia and the lack of raw materials?
@ArturooArtur You should run the imposed sanctions and not just announce them!
@ArturooArtur Sanctions, screw the screw to the resistance and provide Ukraine with as many modern weapons as possible. NATO entry will start a world war.
@ArturooArtur Sanctions, arms delivery, without NATO involvement. I fear conflict not only in Europe!
@ArturooArtur Peaceful NATO intervention and severe sanctions.
@ArturooArtur Definitely sanctions. We are not prepared for an acute NATO response or conflict. Now is the war of Ukraine-Russia. Question who and on which side would join if NATO actually reacted harshly?
Purpose: sanctions were adopted for a specific purpose - the weakening of the Russian war machine. Therefore, as in the case of Mistrala, it was necessary to stop supplies. France would lose its image as an arms supplier, but it would gain as an ally and... well, the homeland of human rights.
China strongly about sanctions. "We do not wish them to influence us" https://t.co/btHFV23YO #chiny-constantly-o-sanctions-we do not wish-to-be-influent-on-us Minister Wang-Yi! Economic sanctions are not a concert of wishes. They are the result of Russia's non-compliance with the law!
For the curious. No... the act of courage was and now #KE will return to the bumps and sanctions on Poland. Optics on Russian bandits also softened. Git! Ukraine's aid plan by the end of the week has been canceled. Sanctions? Tomorrow there will be crayons and Mazas on the pavement. I throw in. Greetings. https://t.co/13Ywuml8SP
@DolinaRoztoki Łolaboga and what about the frame producer will be now? Answer. Those heroes before they went to the advertising session in Kiev probably already established it. Penalties have been for over 2 weeks. They had time.
@DominikKucinsk Why quote the words of a jerk who drove away and does not contact what defeat his miserable Rasija suffered in Ukraine? True that the current sanctions can be put in... but still Rus. are losers...and it is not the end of the Polish army to wipe out Russian survivors in a few days of sobering him up!

@GoodBadTimes_ may I ask you to present what sanctions Poland has imposed against Russia? Poland as a country and not the EU.
@JackStrongAk47 or have already divided Europe .. but today europa has nothing to defend everything reduced sold ruined .. all they have are sanctions.. and so that sometimes the atom does not fall on the berlin is agreed .. Ukraine of the Baltic States and Poland.. etc.
@jasiol7 @lapszynski A on sanctions. If Moscow were to withdraw the sanctions at this point, they would not disappear because the West felt blood, and Russia's withdrawal would be considered a weakness. It is known how the weak end in the war. Only standing Russia can negotiate its fate, that's why (...)
"If I understand correctly the sanctions imposed on the Russians... we cut them off Facebook, Apple, Starbuck and Danone, and they cut off gas, oil, wheat, strategic metals, etc.."
Kaczyński has come up with something? Oh, no, it's me. Post dated February 26th of course the topic for analysis. Putin has to go because sanctions will work. Then we will return to normal borders and rebuild Ukraine with the help of the EU. https://t.co/C6zMb8dZLU
@Kapitan_Hak @jakubiak_marek There will be sanctions and penalties for Poland..
@Kapitan_Hak @jakubiak_marek will introduce sanctions for Poland.
@KarnowskiJakub I would like to remind you that the dead father of President J.B. also received sanctions
Alas, after a brief euphoria, there will be social problems. Yesterday heard in the store, with a clear tone of voice: "at the station expensive, in the shop expensive - I feel like it's on us and not on the increase they imposed these sanctions."
@KrzysztofBrejza Russia will not impose sanctions on its followers, which are writing and solidarity Poland
@culturewplot For me, it makes no sense. How would this affect sanctions?
@lesmal3 @TVN24BIS @tvn24 The European Union can only impose sanctions on Poland,but they are afraid of Russian because it already has them in two hands,for the EU E Nord Strum2 is a Putin weapon but Germany with gas will blackmail the eastern countries.During the II WI they wanted to conquer the countries economically now https://t.co/9oZtVjGFnZ
LIVE: Morawiecki and Kaczyński in Kiev. Further EU sanctions https://t.co/J8B73D0NJK Posted by @updayPL
@MarcinPalade @magorzataPopov supported the annexation of Crimea, the war in Georgia. I do not know if it is a spare Putin but certainly the change on the candlestick in Russia alone will not change much. But the west will be able to endure sanctions. Putin better remain until this Russia spits out quite a bit of teeth.
What is the broader perspective? 1. What concrete actions, apart from the photographs of those who went there to pick them up, will be taken? 2. How would NATO's peace mission (!) take place in a war country? 3. What did Poland propose from each other? Penalties for imports from Russia e.g.?
@Mikolajlach @Tadzik19 @SamPereira_ After all, Orban respects all sanctions so what's the proputinism ? Why tell this propaganda that Hungary is Russia's closest ally probably because it's to squander the PiS, to bump it, only it's weak...
Despite the ban on shutting down air space for aircraft, flights to/from Russia have increased outside carriers. There were 377 such flights over PL (26.02-12.03.) Leads @airserbia and @TurkishAirlines. It is a lack of solidarity with the fact that the lines use sanctions to increase turnover!

@MorawieckiM where are these sanctions?! Why is Kaczyński speaking on behalf of NATO?!!!!! What q forums were these talks about Kaczyński talking about? With le pen and orban?!! @pisorgpl Kaczyński has no mandate to speak on behalf of NATO or EU!!
@MorawieckiM It is high time, for example, for Ukraine for a dandy and slanty one, which will break the wall of indifference of the Polish authorities! No more friendship with Orban, Le Pen and it is high time to impose sanctions from the Polish side! https://t.co/74X4NLh99b
@mswitczak @NewsPlatform Maybe you need to start with yourself and stop calling and voting sanctions against your own voters...
@Neo200405 @wPolityce_pl ...which does not understand not only the meaning of concepts but even words. 3. Assigning Duck's electoral motivations in a situation when war escalates BO SANCTIONS WESTLY DO NOT WORK, and for stopping murders there is a need for another action - it is not only extremely stupid, but bad.
@newodek @GiertychRoman 1. Sending planes on could involve us in a war with no NATO guarantee. 2.You are shouting the constitution. 3.Yes, because they stormed our border immigrants brought by people who murder 4.It can't be that sanctions against hit only

@poor law @ASwirydo @patryciusz wygs @katarynaa He just as opposed to the Germans agreed to sanctions
Pfizer will not withdraw from Russia ! @MZ_GOV_PL will impose sanctions on Pfizer in a gesture of solidarity with Ukraine ?
@pisorgpl @michaldworczyk @PolsatNewsPL Nie Polska, a POLACY. For now, you are faking sanctions.
@PitBrat51 @Marek883177491 The West has grown himself a putin bandit who "foul" them as he wants. For nothing these sanctions, meetings in ties. Diamonds will buy Israel also money for him. Moscow should have a picture of the AU.
@Rafalx85 Ptysia, you have not used half an argument, and you will write to me about reading with understanding. I have indicated to you a specific article, specific actions, don't be ridiculous anymore, please. You can choose which side will become, regardless of sanctions, SC has chosen wrong, that's all.
@R_A_Ziemkiewicz @magorzataPopow I don't think even Onet is so stupid to write that some sanctions will affect decision-makers. They will touch ordinary Russians.
@R_A_Ziemkiewicz So bad and so bad. Germany will only have a problem when Ukraine wins and they will remain without NSII and Schroeder criticizing sanctions
Russia is a state of mind. They imposed personal sanctions on dead father Biden. He will not be able to enter Russia. Soviet mentality in coexistence with Soviet brothel, although #CCCP was an incomparably better organized regime than #Russia #Putler. #UkraineUnderAttack

Russia's sanctions on other countries are kind of like Russia joining Russia's sanctions. https://t.co/SomkQ4zv7j
@SteniaSahaj @ArturColica @JanuszGromotka @PioSlachtowicz @cherilejdi We know how the Russians are going because they wanted to take Kiev in two three days to put up their man and would be "peace" And thanks to Ukraine fighting for so long you have such large sanctions on Russia who didn't expect it to be like in 2014 taking over small sanctions and that's it.
@SteniaSahaj @ArturColica @JanuszGromotka @PioSlachtowicz @cherilejdi Now you have a long fight and hangovers get big sanctions and Ukraine has already "win". It is not that Ukraine wins on all fronts because the south looks hard and the Russians slowly move forward in that region.
@stubix93 @WarNewsPL1 @AGustvonik8 @ArmedForcesUkr Urgent: Ukraine has imposed sanctions on airlines of the Russian Ministry of Defence!
@Sysekp @CamaroJaro There may be a problem with unloading if it turns out that the service will impose its own sanctions.
@Szczery2015 Every day I will remind you, Ziobro and Morawiecki destroyed the rule of law in Poland and imposed sanctions and penalties on Poland (of course indirectly, but they are the cause and reason of these penalties).
@Szczery2015 Putin also doesn't understand why he got sanctions.
The Krauts block sanctions for Russia, fear that their Kraut asses will freeze, and in the name of it they sanction the murder of civilians, children of women, the destruction of cities. They accept barbarism. And along the way they block money for Poland during such a crisis. Superhumans. They. Others let them die.
When are the sanctions on France? https://t.co/xd2wvI2qiK
@tterlikowski How did solidarity show ? If they closed the borders for goods, they stopped or even reduced imports of coal, oil, gas, or what sanctions ... and what did Morawiecki and Kaczyński do ? Without agreement they went and pretended to be NATO and EU ?! https://t.co/8JxZAa2
Only Polish media are touched by the visit of Mr. Jarosław. A visit of a symbolic nature, not a substantive nature, but I hope that someone will ask about the sanctions introduced by Poland https://t.co/kxxthTNPvL
