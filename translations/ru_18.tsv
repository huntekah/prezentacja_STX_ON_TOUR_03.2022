@1999april26 @DobroDobrynia @fanbarca92 @Oleg8221116 @gaudrius @essnooker T.e. If Hitler had won on the sole count of force, he would be right? The position of force justifies anything? I wonder how you live with such a position in the EU. There is a kind of respect for adequacy and civil rights, and the justification of any shit is considered a position of force.
@2Dudin @mariapagachjova position "we're the victim, but we can't strike - we have credits, let us be freed while we pay taxes on the leper" always cheers.
@arturclancy @MoiseivVP Georgia has, like Israel's shirt, closer to the body. Why don't you make it on the sanctions? ...The bipolar position of the barber-me and in the EU wants to cut the cabbages with the Kremlin... but the boomerang will catch up with them.
@dw_russian Evil doesn't know it. It's an irresistible property. A beast that tastes blood will never stop itself. The EU and the US are wasting time taking a position of non-interference that is the essence of the victim's position.
@IchNatalieF Don't say it's on purpose. Now, of course, 100 EU authorities are slowing down. And everyone's afraid it's gonna roll on the brakes. Germany slows down specifically. Bauerbock, where's her position? In 2018, they say we're independent of Ros's energy. And then they start crying.
@quad_licet_Iovi @tinerozvinini @_PLUK_Only for some reason this stand-off is limited to tweeting and active movement towards the EU.
RT @angelys667: @arturclancy @MoiseivVP Georgia, like Israel's own shirt is closer to the body. Why don't you make money on sanctions?...
RT @Vasilisa_Larina: US and EU officials seem to be pushing Russia into storming Ukraine's cities in order to place our countries...
@_So_Va @devnodecon @kameniar_ua Unfortunately it's not a Svnpsina, it's a normal Ukrainian political journalist Bild entering power halls, and then he says the show is at least the position of Germany and the EU.
@SputnikATO The EU position I don't understand either, the guys don't really care what Ukraine is, but they declare it a great country, they're trying to say that Russia has occupied someone, but they don't understand.
@the_ins_ru doesn't know evil, it's an irresistible property, a beast that tastes blood will never stop itself. The EU and the US are wasting time taking a position of non-interference that is the essence of the victim's position.
@tvugi @SvobodadaRadio Da-yeah, that's what they always say when there's no good reason to discuss, your position is lifeless, just like the army, you're led to slaughter like sheep, and you're blazing and puking, and you don't give money to the EU or the U.S. for development, just for war and biolabs, and you're blind, and you're pathetic.
Your unfortunate sanctions, my lord of the EU, no one needs or helps, you have divided the two Slavs and now rule... although on one hand this is Russia's position and policy "Segregate and rule" as it looks.
US and EU officials appear to be pushing Russia to storm Ukraine's cities in order to hold our country responsible for the deaths of civilians.
The EU isn't really messing around with people (mostly adults) talking about how you're gonna put up with someone worse. It's fucking important to me and, like, if it's not there, it's gonna be like: (I'm really gonna cry for a hundred years and my mother forbade me to whining about it and my dad laughs at me comically.
Although Belarus denies the existence of aggressive intentions against Ukraine, its position in the Russian-Ukrainen conflict has led to substantial expansion of the sanctions previously imposed on our country by the EU and the United States. https://t.co/Q41Q92I8nQ https://t.co/qFSavMquWL
"The above-mentioned US and EU officials appear to be pushing Russia to storm Ukraine's major cities in order to hold our country responsible for the loss of civilian lives; we believe that this position is provocative," Peskov concluded.
