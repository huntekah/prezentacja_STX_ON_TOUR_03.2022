@2ironichna4u People, who say that this is a betrayal of debilities. Green didn't say that he was going to remove a word from the constitution about NATO. You just have to be careful right now, and you can do something useful instead of getting yourself involved.
@Andrii_Po I think there will be a lot of questions to the authorities after the war, and if Greenski himself doesn't deal with those Germans-port-Comony-Commony, that will make the terrorist...

Friends, there's another turning point, and you're going to be faced with many things about our delegation surrendering, as if they've already agreed to give the Crimea and we're not aware of it yet, it's bullshit, it's a shit, it's a "Zenese leave" bullshit in the same office.

Green is so wise, saying to the leaders, come to Kiev, it's dangerous here, because the sky is still open.
It seems to me we're making so much of an immunity to fairies that when the Greens fly off to somewhere else when they win, everyone will say, "Yes, it's in Kiev, everybody's going to go ahead" at https:/t.co/bi37IomVA.
I've read the interviews, and I understand that it's now being traded by the Harroche lizo to get out of the war, and the Greens say we don't have to, it's clear that they don't take us there, and the Laczo is saying, well, there's a reasonable man, growing up in security now, and we're going to split up.
