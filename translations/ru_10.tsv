@32_dec And these same people in the front row are screaming what kind of ungrateful refugees we have.
@alyonappova's data are unreliable. Refugees were already there. Living better than Russia? That's when you run out of money to pay citizens' pensions, and you refuse any LDD funding? Is that better? Or when the people in the capital are in Kiev, can't the commune pay, is that better?
@antifa2022 @serial_jane Definitely, some snooze in there, a mess and a trembling, it's because the refugees are coming in stream. somehow we have to reform the system.

@Nino_Giorgidze @Sandy_mustache They would have gone if they'd let them in.Coridors were open only in the west direction. Yesterday Mariupol was opened, so all the refugees went to Russia.

@Sandy_mustache Refugees appeared in Russia in 2014
@Sandy_mustache Long time no concern for German refugees
@Sandy_mustache Did you forget to say that the Donbas refugees had gone to Russia as early as 2015 or was Donbas not considered Ukraine at the time?
@SergNevatnikov @artem_manevich Prices have risen. The floors of Belarus and Russia are on their way here now + refugees from Ukraine, so it's not so surprising. Although Batumi still looks empty compared to the summer season, there aren't any booling or rusophobia, there are some isolated cases.
@sevindj17 @PA00440182 @__Shekili__ @ogeday_nigar Refugees*
@sevindj17 @PA00440182 @hekili__ @ogeday_nigar Seva, I understand your point of view and where I share it. Indeed, there have been many wars with the consent (silent or no) of Europe, and now these refugees are their karma. Everything in this life has to be paid for, but on the other hand, ordinary Germans are not responsible for it, but they kill them.

@Val_Scherbak how you've gotten up with your neuterbrother, he's a racist like 99.9% of the population. I want to see a world where children sit in the laptestan territories in waterless basements like Mariupol, wreckage, blood, tears, refugees, but no one accepts them.
@Vilaaa09 @VansesaBeeley @MuradGazdiev What are you talking about? You have refugees in town? What isolated cases? I would be very happy if Mr. Zelensky were to fall into the hands not of our military, but of the DNR, and no one would cry when they broke him alive for their children.
@Warlukyn @Rogozin, but I'm glad you're coming out, forced LGBT people, the collapse of the family institution, the fall of religion, refugees, and I'm glad you'll disappear in a generation.
@zenonBk @HawkTrades @sphetslaclub @elonmusk @Rogozin The point is that most residents from western Ukraine are travelling to Poland and refugees from eastern and southern Russia. Unfortunately, residents of western Ukraine may not even know what their government is doing in eastern and southern Ukraine. Talk to residents of Donbass.
@zislik @Sandy_ mostache refugees from Syria fled in 2011, only they first fled to Turkey, and then Erdogan let them into the Europa, blackmailing and selling their dinghys for themselves.

In the evenings, I volunteer to head up to the Hauptbahnof station, where the refugees arrive and where there is a lack of Russians/language volunteers, you'd see how much pain in the eyes of the new arrivals... with one heavy bag, empty eyes, with crying children, with hope for a better future.
On TV, it was said that Ukrainian refugees in Moldova are fucked up about how they've been taken up and demanded the comfort of the Dude. I'm not gonna believe this shit in my life. Any man who can logically think it's an insolent motherfucker. People who run away from the war won't do that.
