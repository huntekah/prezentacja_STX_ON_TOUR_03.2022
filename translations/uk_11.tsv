RT @zynicism: It was so paphosified: densification and de-nationalization.
@Segozavr @JustinTradu I cannot keep track. Is this still Ukraine's denacification, or is it a biology laboratory in Ukraine?
@seroffs Sha! It's a denaclation. https://t.co/kBjCqyL6T
@valeriaarnaud Denasification, demilitarization, derusion
@Winter_Avis93 he is so dried up) the official face of the cross. To international space he passes (1) that he himself does not obey the laws of his country and uses the forbidden resource) (2) nazbl, which has black people and non-conventional problems) deaction, which is what)
