@AdiJedryka I talked about this in one of the podcasts probably in January, Nets could do it, but I don't think they dared because the image crisis and NBA problems would have been horrible. Besides, Nets owner has an opinion about vaccination.

Are you guys having a mental crisis lately?
@Elbieta96608116 @KuczynskiG @Cenckiewicz I do not agree with this approach. Everyone expressing such an opinion assumes that "Russia has agreed with Poland in NATO." The fact is that they demand a return to the state of 1997. If not for Chechnya and the 1997 Gosp crisis, they would attack us, just like now Ukraine.
@Firarafaa Given the demographic crisis in PL (there is no one to do children), refugees from Ukraine are at the weight of gold. I hope that many of them will stay in Poland permanently
I didn't know that.
if it were to create in Poland for a period of 1 year a zone in which PiS would rule for its voters and POs for its voters, then after a year where PO ruled has a worse economic situation than in North Korea and at the border of these zones there would be an emigration crisis https://t.co/SPYA5XeqdC
@grabarczyktomek I got it!!! You take care of Polish and Poles!!! The crisis is pounding on the door and you are fucking about them tasty jokes!!!
Iranian Foreign Minister: The crisis in Ukraine must be resolved by diplomatic means #the war #UkraineRussianWar #UkraineUnderAttask #Ukraine
@jbrudzinski Organizer is the EU, it was decided at the summit in Versailles, and the delegation goes as a delegation of EU support. The benefits are strong, propaganda, highlighting the unity of the EU in looking at this crisis, and thinking that the EU will not let go.
If this is true, it shows that everything can be broken in the Union, and when the crisis (e.g. wartime) comes, they have the rule of law and democracy somewhere. Poland does not deserve money from #KPO until it meets the conditions! Simple as a shoe. https://t.co/2GSGwcpmAp
@JNizinkiewicz A Macron has experienced a crisis
@jol_kozlowska @Ten_Psychologist So far before going to Kiev, these polls haven't moved. Now they'll probably go up, but not for long. The humanitarian crisis is about to start - the government doesn't give a shit about refugees and volunteers are already getting weaker.
Katarzyna Cichopek UKRYWALKED the marriage crisis in front of friends: "For everyone it was SHOW"
@KopicMaciej The worst possible government has suffered the most severe crisis for Poland since the Second War.
The humanitarian crisis is an opportunity to help and realize the value of the right to life? No, for Godek are just other addressees and addressees of propaganda against the election. Her blindfolds do not fall, but may fall off its followers. https://t.co/5f3Aa2OZz5

@lalakowska You can see a crisis in a relationship.
@ligudka12 @Kapitan_Nomada if you don't get involved quickly, our problems today will be pampered against what awaits us. The consequences of Ukraine's collapse are a threat of aggression on the PL, millions of refugees from Ukr all over Europe, food crisis all over the world
@Magdale870011838 The crisis of the century is evident here
@Malgorz76831873 @Bozena54146627 @Joannamysz @JSaryuszWolski @RadioZET_NEWS @JKowalski_postel And as for the crisis in 2008 it was the world crisis I recommend to educate and not duplicate lies.Thanks to what the government of Tusk has guaranteed us our country has not failed. Please read only later to speak. And above all, do not lie.
I have an existential crisis and I think there's definitely help.
I'm having a senior crisis, and I have the slightest feeling that someone understands me.
@mamitoincognito thank you because I had a crisis when I made them.
@Marcin Palade @onetpl I think it surprised the West as much as the resistance of Ukraine. I think they were quietly hoping that Ukraine would fall in two days and that we would have a humanitarian crisis with refugees and that we would be hostile to them.
@MariuszBuj @Jola64471 @AnnaSiarkowska @Agiewillow and if we are somehow balanced, we should only care about peace in our immediate surroundings... because in war we really lose, refugee crisis, energy plus food - hunger may be waiting for us...
@markste00554141 @piszek_marek @ryszcuk Well, let's talk about facts. Let's start with how many U.S. ballistic missiles have been installed in Ukraine so that we can make sure that the Cuban crisis can be compared to the current situation in Ukraine.
@Mateusz Wieloch1 @Doors_pl @_marcinho19 @Bucholz_Adam @Skijumpingpl Norway had a deeper crisis only in the 2001/2002 season and even then it was clearly better than now Finland.
@MigarskiJerszy @PabloMo09825801 I don't really understand it because war, but we have really big internal problems. War and refugee crisis only deepens it. I notice another polarization of moods for many reasons. I'm probably on the side of the ZOMO?
@mp_sadlowski I think it's thinking per analogy from 1917 and 1991. Russia's crisis is a breakdown. I just never know who apart from the outskirts could disconnect. Chechnya, Dagestan? Tatarstan probably is already too integrated.

@Pawel_Lbn @Andrzej50602325 @LeszekDabrowa @St_Janecki The blocked funds are related to the fact that it is a loan that we have to pay. And the humanitarian crisis is that we will have to choose what to spend money on, because we have a budget that is modest. Save the economy because someone has to pay the health care, because Covid, or refugees.
@PCHSKALPEL And yet a beautiful crisis with anesthesiologists is preparing... the worst team in @MZ_GOV_PL ever.
@PJozwiak_1 This is not quite how it works. Churchill ended up winning World War II and still lost the election. The patriotic increase was huge, but the exhaustion of people even greater. The only chance of PiS is the expired elections before inflation and the crisis caused by war will exhaust people.
@PMLeonarski An will forgive you, but there was an even bigger humanitarian crisis in Syria, and you didn't write it like that.
There is a dental crisis coming in Russia. There is a shortage of seals - seriously. As it goes on, the Russians will return to old trends and instead of treating they will rip out and put in gold teeth! #Sanctions
Poland can most likely count on some international support to help refugees, but it is difficult to expect it to be significant. The EU has only €370 million in 2022 for an unexpected humanitarian crisis.
Nearly 1 million Ukrainian households are cut off from electricity. Water, food and medicines are missing. Civil casualties are increasing. https://t.co/oOntkYWJXc
The Prime Minister who has not prepared the country for the energy crisis, the Deputy Prime Minister for Security who was surprised by the war, the Minister of Health who has no influence on anything, the Minister of Justice who massacres the justice system, the Minister of the Ministry of Home Affairs who does nothing with 2 million refugees.

We give support to Ukraine. On February 24, 2022 Russia barbarically attacked its neighbour, Ukraine. This aggression has also caused a great humanitarian crisis in addition to death and destruction. #Solidarnizukrain #FreeUkraine #FreeUkraine #Ukraine https://t.co/UP0brp0KQU
@radio_357 This is what happened for the entry about the war in Ukraine. "The crisis in Ukraine is a convenient excuse for the Rusophobia" Holy words https://t.co/Tp61ga3Dnx
@ReginaMisz In a moment there will be a huge economic crisis in Poland - expensive, no work for Poles because the non-government accepts millions of refugees! At whom order? - America that wanted to take over Ukraine, which Russia does not agree to, because they agreed otherwise. https://t.co/cATKQ7fcvz
Russia consciously violates international law and provokes #crisishumanitarian @IES_Lublin https://t.co/u6xxaQhlIM
Russian soldiers are deliberately destroying agricultural equipment in Ukraine, and the Ukrin inform agency informed us on Tuesday, referring to the post of the Ukrainian intelligence in the Telegram communicator. Yesterday Mr. Jackowski spoke, it may turn out that not war and the crisis could make us stronger.

@sikorskiradek @grupaepl @Platforma_org Sceptyczna yes. Cowardly? Not necessarily. They are too far away to have an adequate sense of danger. Their potential economic slowdown and fuel crisis are worried. What Ukraine or even Poland feels when looking close is remote and almost virtual.
@soobinxyluv crisis had
@zarlmusi I told you you'd still have a skill crisis? Don't worry about it and keep going. You'll have to buy the ride and buy it and don't worry. Not for every 30h it's enough. I personally needed over 40h and passed the second time ;]
@Shefernaker Mr. Dear, less PR and propaganda, more action. Let's get on with it, because so far NGOs and ordinary people are dealing with a refugee crisis for you. Leave the propaganda to Kursk.
This book also says everything: "It is a diagnosis of the current crisis of Europe on the example of the most important countries of the West. The most valuable in Magierowski's analysis is to show that the crisis of the West is not just a financial or economic collapse today." 1/2
This trip is needed regardless of how much it would also function as part of the electoral campaign. However, we are probably at the last sensible moment for early elections - so (excluding some major political crisis) these are probably not going to take place. https://t.co/NZ3K2Mt1Bu

@traskowski_You have a moral crisis, work on it, not on the line, and on the left line you are.
@txyn1 The answer is fairly simple though it may not be visible. The US does not want the Russian troops in the Western Hemisphere (the crisis in the Bay of Pigs) and FR does not want the AU in NATO so war. It is a pity that our eagles do not see it.
With us this is already a humanitarian crisis, whether the resettlement crisis begins

@yrizona_ If you want to watch a show with sexism, racism and homophobia, it's probably better to watch the 13th Precinct. At least there are important social topics: - housing crisis (Czarek) - sexwork (Jola) - mid-life crisis (Commandant) - homelessness (Homeless Janek)

@ZandbergRAZEM You know... The rental prices were crazy because the loans were crazy and no one did anything about the availability of the apartments. Left too. And for the housing crisis, knowing the government, there's probably gonna be a remedy in the form of "tenants' protection," which will really stop the rent to refugees.

@zhongpussy @yutaolyre What the fuck is going on?
@ZZadzior @jakubwiech I don't know, it can be that way. Every crisis causes us to try to change behaviour but I don't know about social issues. I'm afraid who would finance this reconstruction. Even if Ukraine goes to the EU and the EU wants 'cohesion', the EU doesn't want to have problems like with PL.
