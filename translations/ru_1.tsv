@alyonopova @mysyssoft Ukraine does not want to live in racial shit. https://t.co/vIc3VenymU
@alyonopova your Ukraine is no one in this world, neither Russia, nor America, nor Europe. Ukraine was used as a springboard.
@alyonopova would have lived like this for 30 years, no racing, no yelling and no russiophobia... only the West, a full and happy Ukraine didn't need a fucking duck...
@antikua Why not Ukraine?

Without the forest, Ukraine will become a steppe and desert.
@ex_hurma So Ukraine didn't feel real what was happening on Donbas.
@GazetaRu @ZhukovV1 then asks what the fuck Russian fascist army is doing in Ukraine now?
@girlcrushpower They haven't been interested in this topic for eight years, and now genius political scientists. Eight years, the authorities have done everything they can to resolve the conflict peacefully and tell them that Ukraine has done everything for this development, they won't hear it. If it wasn't for this confession, all of this would have continued.
@gleben92 @leno4kova @Vahazar @Ivanopulo What did it say? Ukraine's almost civilized state?
@helensmail560 It's not true! In all Western media, there's been information about how the Russians bombarded Donetsk, their public is very outraged, and Donetsk is Ukrainian.
At https://t.co/82vzCefPpd, "Ukraine is a free country that has chosen a democratic European path." I tried to say it out loud, but already on the word "free" my cheekbones have gone down.
@jannaramasanov1 @cgtnrussian You'd better worry about your fucking blair and don't bring a fatty in there. Ukraine will not kneel in front of the Russians.
@jkotia_minyongi has been asked. What's better? "Surely a major war with Russia and a transition to NATO based on the results of the victory over Russia." Here's Ukraine, in the desire of power, and now pays that price.
@kosmodenchik @3a6aHeh @Geradbe @USApoRusski @POTUS Who told you that NATO and Ukraine are allies? Ukraine for NATO is a testing ground and a place to sell weapons.
@kosmodenchik @Anna37943193 @GazetaRu Just Ukraine and Belarus were occupied by the Russians before the Sovka, that's all. And "Brother peoples" are all fairy tales for the poor-- Private Russian hates all the other nations of the world, even his countrymen.
@Kremlinpool_RIA, that's sad, because this is the real fact of essentially terrorism from Ukraine, but they chose to establish that Ukraine is a peaceful democratic country.
@KremlinRussia 2,357 civilians died in Mariupol, Ukraine. https://t.co/NRzrkkbcMD
@LooksLikeLeks Well, and then some smart people say Ukraine is bombing itself
@MatthewdAncona As those who are superficially familiar with history know, Ukraine NEVER intended to join NATO. With the departure of the Russian Black Sea fleet from Sevastopol, this was a failure. Russia has already controlled most of Ukraine &apos; s strategic points and had a great influence in the internal affairs of Ukraine. https://t.co/c7Rf8BC1s0
@NashaCanada were Ukrainian and Belarusian fronts because the German army attacked from the western side, where Ukraine was with Belarus.
@Nata12370123 @sadovnichaya @Veronic25101851 @LooksLikeLeks @BonzzzaRay do we ask you to come? Everyone has a struggle. You'd better think about where Putin's money has spent 20 years in Russia. We're not Ukraine. We're literally familiar with the country. I don't urge you to understand the issue, but you can just read the history of Germany 30s. or the USSR.

According to the Russian fascists, Ukraine is able to bomb its cities without giving way to the occupiers.

..that all these talkers on TV will be the first to escape Russia, that all these eight years on TV there's one Ukraine, Europe, America... none of the issues have gone without them, like the Russian Federation has no business and no economy, and this strange relationship with China will put us in a trap at all.
That's if we agreed to do business with her, but it's not like that, and what do you think if Ukraine joined NATO we'd still be living sweetly? You motherfuckers think that if we were against them, they'd be threatening us with nuclear missiles already.
