@1984w1984 Orwell Putin didn't think he'd do it here in three days, explosions in three warehouses, stocking all the ministers until 14th year, they were counting our capabilities from how they contributed to reducing these possibilities.
@andersolund That crazy bastard Putin and his assassins jokingly called into the army and look at the devastation and death that you caused, and you'll all pay dearly for your cruelty.
@ArmedForcesUkr @gtconway3d Plus 1 Stock Market. Putin is afraid to open Moscow Stock Market.
@ArmedForcesUkr you have to launch a rocket at the center of Moscow to make Putin see that Ukraine is not weak, and to stop the attack, only the defense gives the enemy control.
@bryhynets, of course, the pathin has a powerful compromise on green.
@bryhynets He's got a gut of thin--maybe this posse of silicon is very sensitive to him and how Satan's parting and business can only die that way.

The n-day of the war of the war against Ukraine, the scareev's show suddenly bursts into a chain with the cries of "Marina Osenitscher, my hero," all shouting "Well, he's so brave," "he's in danger," "he's in trouble" * it's all burrily

@StationCDRKelly unfortunately it's not.--the general monarchist of the imperial, for example, is a path to the nature of power and in the early years was much more liberal and practical--faster than the oppositionist, but an FSB agent who should play the oppositioner, just like a fatty and a jubilant.

In Mariupolis, there's a lot of demand for women doctors, without a résumé and a job interview, there's a security condition for Putin himself. https:/t.co/LFgJkqHwA8.

The Council of Europe session.
The evil tongues say that when the two prime ministers of the EU came to war in Ukraine, they tried to calm the Bubok who was scavengeing, sign everything that Putin sent. The Kremlin, through Herrma, manipulates what it wants, so Putin doesn't surrender, because I'm sure he will.

Fuck you, you fucking rockets, you fucking Russian, you fuckin' bitch!
One fact that that girl with a poster on her shoulder in her video said that Putin was the only one responsible for the war, and that's a good reason for Ukrainians not to share their infu and not to support her.
The main mass of russeme merchants, because they support this war, and the path of this war wouldn't have done it on its own, didn't have to cut down the number of cities, didn't take the number of lives, he couldn't have been able to spend it alone, so it's enough to rest the enemy's action, there's no truth.
Secret data has shown that the path slips #StopRussia
Putin is conducting a terrorist and genocide war against the Ukrainian people. Why are EU and U.S. politicians concerned when it comes to protecting Ukraine's peaceful population, which is destroying the Putin missiles from Russia.
