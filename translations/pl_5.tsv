#Inflation also in the "production" of law In 2021, 20 960 pages of the new law were passed, i.e. 40.5% more than a year ago. Hurry, lack of consultation and breach of standards caused, among others, chaos related to #PolandŁad. More in #BarometerRight https://t.co/z2361C6Obt https://t.co/6Q8jNGmhdn
Inflation in February fell to 8,5% y/y from 9.4% y/y in January. The main factors affecting its reduction were anti-inflationary shields on fuels and food.
This is how inflation works https://t.co/LPWhcNuE0k
@acosta_re_nata What is it now? For self-government? And rising like inflation, fuel prices or interest rates? Now you can combine dots or at least try not to push the smart lady.
@AliceDef A previous inflation what was it?
@AnnaSiarkowska I know that this is how I support Ukraine but without excessive costs on the Polish side: Type of petrol after 20pln Two-digit inflation Demeaning Poles by favoring refugees That's why I do not ban and throw onukami
@barbaramusyczuk @tobik2012 @Wujooooo @bozenalisowska You will not convince them that weak gold and inflation 5% is even a conscious and announced government policy. The problem is that they have ceased to control it (PiS and NBP)
@BocianRobert @Kacper13966379 @JkmMikke Well and great. Let the Confederation lose and go away with all their voters (translate with idiots, because only morons vote for them). Stay with us PIS and PO forever. We will give you 14, 15 and 16 and pretend that inflation is Russian faults.
Boris: It will take several quarters to control inflation and will require further strengthening of monetary policy https://t.co/6biAv4pcSB
@Bozenalisowska @AnnaLaso Bo still has a dollar rate - it is paid in dollars and inflation. For example, the tanker driver made about 2 thousand zlotys, now 6-7 thousand. Please do not do economics for the poor.
I often get questions about how to "run away with money" from Poland (though part of it). KNF, NBP and rising inflation are doing their job. Frankly, I am not surprised by these questions. I think I found a solution to keep the foreign reserve outside of Poland. https://t.co/zAdPEhgegj

@e_bartkowska @AnnaGorska_PL Excessive humanitarianism and emotionalism are the manipulation of the 21st century. None of them will be put in the pot when recession comes and inflation, additionally driven by money print, will glide.

#Inflation in Poland in February 2022 amounted to 8.5 percent, more than the economists expected. Anti-inflationary shield 2.0 did not work with the same power as expected.

The inflation is temporarily falling from the record. The GUS provided data for February https://t.co/A1XGEm7vL0 Optimism!
Dollar inflation in 2021: 4.7% Yuan inflation in 2021: 0.9% In February, dollar inflation was 7.9%. Currently, Russia, Saudi Arabia and India are considering a transition to accounting in yuan. Last time a dollar had to be saved, rates rose from 5% to 20%. Currently, it is &lt;1%. https://t.co/gxstAiJ9q
The inflation was supposed to fall from 9.2% in February to 8.1%, and we're actually 8,5%. In March 2022, "I'M COMING" and it's going to come from high C. Now the excessive creation of money and "unchanged amounts of cash" will be revenged.

@JakubMajmurek Fucking and scary. Like with inflation it was supposed to be 10-12% is 8.5%.
@JarekKoscielny It turns out that 28%. After @MorawieckiM "found" in September 2021 in 429 billion extra 80 billion budget it was known that inflation was at least 20%... https://t.co/CqqP042g2y
@jbrudzinski What rubbish. You rule so well, and even wreckage after all these years, you cannot bring home. Your governments are covered with a big social failure. Same as shocking inflation and prices. You are incompetent as you are losing gold on value.
@jbrudzinski PiS is the worst thing that has happened to Poland in recent years. The level of neglect and budget burning ruins us economically- see inflation, interest rates. Orlen drains Poles' pockets.

@LMiklusiak @UOKiKgovPL Inflation is an action on the currency basket, of course also in relation to the speed and amount of money in circulation.

In the following months, prices of goods and services will be increased by the effects of the war, including the soaring oil prices https://t.co/G8mXVJYNKH
@Maciej180844501 @wykobik With prices at stations it is always so expensive because either they have expensive supplies or they have expensive current purchases;) Seriously, it is probably (real) inflation (although "dark") so far higher than the fall in wholesale prices and therefore we do not yet feel this drop.
@MennicaSkarbowa Good. The inflation will fall.
@NewsweekPoland You now have your buttocks up to your knees... so you counted with Tusk and the opposition that inflation will exceed 10%, the same with the fuel... as you will play Schroder's cones.
We do not know the exact weights in the new energy and fuel consumption mix today, but we can presume that base inflation accelerated to around 6.5% y/y in February. The final data on NBP base inflation will be published tomorrow. https://t.co/nSKHLcnXB4

@OnetNews Gold is getting stronger, inflation is falling. Does that mean that Glapiński will refrain from ruining people's lives with loans? No. Pis found a good way to take the workers to have them for the losers.
@Mrs._Scarlett Inflation, confusion in courts, blockade of billions from the Union by the stubbornness of Minister Z. About Ostrołęka and 2mld on TVP not to mention. But it doesn't matter that you saw hydra, so you have to vote for the PiS!
@Pawel539461681 @RChodkowski 2000-2001 my student times ;) I remember hoping that if you had a cookie, you'd put it on the spot and live like a king... I didn't know what inflation was.
@Pawel_Lbn @Andrzej50602325 @LeszekDabrowa @St_Janecki Nation will not last long, inflation and expensive plus.
@PIE_NET_PL According to NBP models, food inflation is expected to reach 20%.
@piotr_rataj Just create a copy with more inflation + a copy of Anchor protocol with 30% interest and eats out the competition.
@PJozwiak_1 This is not quite how it works. Churchill ended up winning World War II and still lost the election. The patriotic increase was huge, but the exhaustion of people even greater. The only chance of PiS is the expired elections before inflation and the crisis caused by war will exhaust people.
@Adjustable2 The Homeland Defense Act assumes that funds for military investment will also come from the NBP. The Polish State will tax the population with inflation in order to issue a large 300 thousand armies. I'm afraid we will end up like Venezuela.
@presidentpl @AndrzejDuda But now you're going on a tour... As everything has been set since month Pi$ warms roller skates, because political gold is about to escape and will be left without war photos... And again they will ask about #inflation #pegasus #nepotism #aferyPiS... #PiS #failors
