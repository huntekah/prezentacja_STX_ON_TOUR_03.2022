@ballphilosoph @andersostlund It takes little to stop the war. Just the following two words: "Russian Armed Forces! Stop the fire! Stop the advance! Retire! This is an order! To execute!"
@brian4NY @NBCNewYork And this is pretty much everything you need to know about US politics, and why they did everything they could to make this war happen. Pathetic.
@CNNPolitics Those weapons will just help for a prolong war that will result  in a total distraction of Ukrainian lives and cities. Why not encourage Zenlesky to follow diplomacy and if possible abandon his NATO illusion in order to restore Ukraine again.

@countersign10 @SU_57R @MapsUkraine Yeah, no.  Ukraine WANTS the foreigner volunteers dying in Ukraine to leverage NATO involvement.  You, being the keyboard moral arbiter, don‚Äôt get to tel ppl they NEED to die in a country that isn‚Äôt theirs in a war with two corrupt governments.
@cvpayne Joe ignores the US. S. Borders illegals &amp; Afghans get US $. War is a waste. Help America. UR vote is to blame. Joe ruining the US, 1 rotten decision after another. Proactive diffuses. Our weak military, blame Joe &amp; Kamala for Ukraine pretending to solve self-created problems.
