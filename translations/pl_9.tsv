@0xKubi Apparently Hitler didn't know about the Holocaust. Eth won't go to POS. They'll still promise and people will be stuck in it and pay beautiful commissions for their own resources. Thank you for your attention.

@CryptoPodroze @play_nity and their $ply best staking and probably in the future the highest return rate so far in execution (difference 3-5% of the final return) $rune, $luna, $eth, $wave and $skrt. And now buys the above in local dimples averaging the price again.
But remember the money said shey in eth has a lot of secrets?
Hey because Kasia said the end of the hell is gonna be beautiful, and 26 eth Nate asked Vic a question you love me, and if the story ends so that at their wedding Vic will say to Natea, yes Nate I fucking love you.
Hey 'cause there's supposed to be a funeral in eth, and the ending of the chapter was, so to speak, uninteresting #pizgaczhell https://t.co/HPGDV2CzHo
The money said she had to hide from us after 29 eth. So what if victoria responds to Nate? #pizzaczhell

I didn't come up with a brilliant plan. I didn't finish the whole saf on the wattpad so I want to finish the 2nd round by the end of the week. I quickly read bth and eth to read the last chapter of eth #pizgaczhell on April 10th
New chapter eth= new chapter/y from Sheya's notebook #pizgaczhell https://t.co/vjFA3BgTLQ
@PiotrOstapowicz BTC and ETH so far without frenzy, on the CAKE and FTM target, but still a little bit more...
@PiotrOstapowicz I don't have a BNB and ETH thrown on the staking so that there is a grain of grain to grow.
@PiotrOstapowicz Buys regularly every week for more than 4 months, $BTC (30 UAH) +$ETH+$BNB+$HBAR (after 20 UAH). The time horizon has been taken at least 5 years, and probably reach 10 - then my children will be approaching 20 ;)
@PiotrOstapowicz I buy every week after 25euro BTC and eth if (Ma &gt;30, and fear grey index&gt;30) and also 50euro.in USC for inheritance -20% in week BTC eth and some opportunity for cheap alta.
@PiotrOstapowicz I buy regularly, once a week, but only $BTC and $ETH. Bitcoin may never sell.
@PiotrOstapowicz Similarly, every week BTC + ETH and selected alta: SOL DOT ADA BNB LINK + selected alt However, looking at the market I wonder whether not to play on the declines
@PiotrOstapowicz I start with small capital (for the moment I have uploaded 600 zł of which part is and will be added to eth and btc with possible partial realisation of profits every now and then, in addition, I spent 200 on alt learning and somehow ~15$ I am ahead of what they showed me that the plan is a challenge.
@PiotrOstapowicz You inspired me and flies every week dca btc/eth. Buy falls on Tuesdays
@piotr_rataj Btc + Eth, a percentage less profit than on alts, but at least a quiet head, in the long term
@piotr_rataj That's why at this stage we're not sure what's likely to survive: btc eth ltc
@piotr_rataj Exactly why I came out of everyone leaving only a little of these "tested" better safe 70%BTC 25%ETH, and on alta leftovers....
@piotr_rataj Eth is the only altcoin it accumulates.
@piotr_rataj First ;) I come out of a luna bought on average at $14. I'm still swinging unfortunately with ltc at $140 Rest of eth and btc 50/50
I've got to make up for the old chapters 'cause I've only read the first two of them with eth.
@Robert51181998 @piotr_rataj The face of ETH is a hangover. From Canada, but still a hangover. The sea is not good for it. Besides, or above all. It is an inefficient project, without scalability. EtH 2.0 was already supposed to be, and here neither sight nor hear.
