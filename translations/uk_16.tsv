@Frialum There is no time frame spoken of. It could have been conditional before the conflict began, rather than the answer to yesterday's scream with parashi
@gauravswant @ZelensyUa 1/2 President @ZelenskyUa @DefenceU @MFA_Ukraine, lack of foresight, cost the permanent destruction of the country in ruins and the loss of life of innocent Ukrainians. He has shown little interest in joining the @NATO membership long before the conflict began.
@Geeta_Mohan @ZelenskyUa @ZelenskyUa you want to understand such an IRATIONAL request for an impossible @NATO membership on the 1st day of conflict. You have invested FEARING VIBES in @KremlinRussia_E, and now all Ukrainians pay prices in the last 19 days of the conflict. Confirm this conflict and save lives.

@neumerherwam it would be great for me that China is now more comfortable to pay off part of the refrigeration, almost without fighting, and in the pericardium to become even more powerful, and to get only the condemnation of the community, to enter the harbor and to have the destructive effects of the conflict.
@N_K_down note of the political leader's phrase on the conflict in Israel, which was said long ago as the world recognized who Posachenko was. It is not necessary to replace the names of the state with great political experience. If you want to make fun of who was first and what was said.
@olebatkovic question. we have eight years of war with Moscow.
@olehbatkovych heard the theory that now it's going to go into the territory list, that it needs to be returned to end the conflict, and that Georgia might also be reminded of Ossetia.

@paczvarny @whereismyplace @patsychka which is that? You know, you know, the Russian troops are storming the blades of the Belarusian area and that they're using the Belarusian polyglots to launch rockets? That's true, whites is a side of conflict.
@porizna if there are ideas like, it's going to work because I already feel like I'm an hysterical, and I'm not going to let everyone feel sorry for me, and I'm going to let everyone down on either side of the conflict.

@Tetra_25Pak @Olha_Rev in a large way, but it's a Utopia because other countries are not in conflict. In fact, if the powder of their time hadn't restored the PPO to Kiev for their own money, the capital would have already been a pile of eggs like Kharkiv.
The second army of the world has recognized Ukrainian farmers as a side of conflict.
@Yonchi_Z UN has not decided any conflicts in the world. This is the same farce as the defendant has the right to a court decision.
@ZelenskyUa you are required to understand this IRRACONAL request for an impossible @NATO membership from day 1 of conflict. You have invested FEAR VIBES in @KremlinRussia_E, and now all Ukrainians pay the price in the last 19 days of the conflict. Confirm this conflict and save lives. https:///t.c.GRsk3I
Bayden will fly to Europe through Ukraine-NBC. The probability of the U.S. president's visit is high, American journalists are writing. The white house is now working on organizational issues. But the exact dates are not called.
It also predicts a significant movement to resolve the conflict in the next two or three days.

I think there's a real economic and social impact that needs to happen to the ilit, to the kids and the grandchildren, and that can lead to an internal conflict with certain consequences, so you don't have to wait until you're dead, you have to act.
A few days before, by the way, I had a hard fight with my friends and a boy, and we didn't re-wrote for three days, and of course, the reconciliation was crucial, because it was more important to me than the cause of the conflict and the pride of our own.

Mmm, and these are the mediators of the conflict?
There's no conflict, there's no table of negotiations and compromises, and the Russians are coming to kill the Ukrainians and take their land and their cities, it's a war to eliminate one another.
this attempt to show two sides of conflict is not like tolerance, but as naive, cowardly, even stupid.

Yes, NATO will join the conflict, but only in case of a threat to the destruction of the Army of Mordor and the transition of the ECU into RF as you advance to Moscow. NATO will never forgive Ukraine for destroying its eternal enemy. Because this will mean the elimination of the alliance itself. https:/t.co/UL9NF95e
