The most dangerous phase of Ukraine's war with Russia is now under way, and the former Special Representative of the United States Department of State for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, considers that "The Wayne knows what is losing and doubles the aggression, even when its strategic position weakens..." #stopputinnow
@alexxbezz @Lilith_Ta_Old She literally says that "Ukraine stands for NATO" and the US supports it in this. What the hell is a neutral country supposed to protect a military alliance? She's a Pretorian guard? In fact, an outrageous position. You die for us and we'll give you a round of applause.
@anatoliisharii and the U.S. also don't give a special visa, a very convenient position to accept refugees.
@for4naiin @harmash_artem @Ghostikdota what do you really grow out of what test?? Where is the civic position? Where is the desire to live? Where is the country where a person is willing to live??? And not to earn money and be in the United States.
@GolosAmeriki 2)... how do you end your friendship with the U.S.? If it was her position as a man, half-win, and as head of Georgia, it's a loop on the neck of all the people!
@kzrtsv's position is simple. The U.S.'s race fucks "international law" means their requirements are not taken into account.
@Muglhupfer @walawer @GazetaRu There's no bloodless warrior, I don't think you've been whining around the U.S. embassy when they've been making wars around the world, there's a position, that's where you're now because you're helpless, sucker...
@nikitasio @DemocratRussian This inhuman position: "Let children fuck trannies in the United States, let Communists execute Christians in China." Moreover, dangerous: If an enemy is established inside its world, it will inevitably spread around and try to reach us, through Hollywood, for example, to sabotage.
@rianru let them know that we have a principled position, and no one will bat in front of the US.

@sahouraxo @wY6NHU0FqJptqM Policy Position of the US, UK and EU
@tvugi @SvobodadaRadio Da-yeah, that's what they always say when there's no good reason to discuss, your position is lifeless, just like the army, you're led to slaughter like sheep, and you're blazing and puking, and you don't give money to the EU or the U.S. for development, just for war and biolabs, and you're blind, and you're pathetic.
@YankoDalt @yarka_slava @nulwatcher @max_katz Position that if you'd stepped out of your subway or started to resonate on the Internet precisely that you weren't against us, that you were against the war in general, and that you didn't want to die for US wealth, we would have supported you.
