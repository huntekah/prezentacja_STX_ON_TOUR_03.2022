At least Ukrainian refugees make it into the country before they’re faced with some of the issues. Across Europe, vaccine and other covid restrictions are in place. Arriving refugees to Germany for example need to show they’ve been vaccinated, or get one  https://t.co/Yxdq8btYaZ

Do we need the governments approval? I've been to many places in SA where covid protocols are not being adhered to and people are free. I walk into the place feeling like a fool for wearing a mask. We need to protest against this. #nationalstateofdisaster
Does covid leave behind intense coughing or did i catch a random cold

It’s obvious to me covid was created to depopulate then they realized it wasn’t as effective as they wanted, therefore the additional jabs spread spike proteins &amp; now the “stealth variant” is upon us as the final stage to weed out those with said compromised immune systems.

@MarcLobliner Remember all the people who got Covid prior to the vaccine and lived?  Man, crazy times.  Then most turned around, got the vaccine, then got Covid… again… and thanked the vaccine for it not being too bad.  😂
@MrBean33 @Gray_Mackenzie Bahaha so funny. Without the vaccine and when you get Covid… your brain will be mush in 5 years.
@NancyBristol4 @SPBMcKenna Your location says Sydney.  That’s an interesting way to put it. Much like the draconian actions of the Australian government on covid measures. You should have the freedom to chose correct? Or is the freedom to chose just a pawn for you when it’s convenient.

@TimFitzsimmons_ @samanthamaiden People are really upset at Marshall opening up.  Many dislike the deaths and fear since then.  Others see the falling restrictions now we have Covid and think: what were the 2 years of job killing about?  All see our health system crack.  This is local.
@trestrange Still think that this is a 'staged' war. To propagate fear, to enforce new laws, remove freedoms, change boundaries to suit main players. To push arms sales. Like covid this war smells.
